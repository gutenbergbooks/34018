<p><span class="bold">ANJAR,<a name="ar1" id="ar1"></a></span> a fortified town of India, and the capital of a district
of the same name in the native state of Cutch, in the presidency
of Bombay. The country is dry and sandy, and entirely depends
on well irrigation for its water supply. The town is situated
nearly 10 miles from the Gulf of Cutch. It suffered severely
from an earthquake in 1819, which destroyed a large number of
houses, and occasioned the loss of several lives. In 1901 the
population was 18,014. The town and district of Anjar were
both ceded to the British in 1816, but in 1822 they were again
transferred to the Cutch government in consideration of an
annual money payment. Subsequently it was discovered that
this obligation pressed heavily upon the resources of the native
state, and in 1832 the pecuniary equivalent for Anjar, both
prospectively and inclusive of the arrears which had accrued to
that date, was wholly remitted by the British government.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANJOU,<a name="ar2" id="ar2"></a></span> the old name of a French territory, the political
origin of which is traced to the ancient Gallic state of the <i>Andes</i>,
on the lines of which was organized, after the conquest by
Julius Caesar, the Roman <i>civitas</i> of the <i>Andecavi</i>. This was
afterwards preserved as an administrative district under the
Franks with the name first of <i>pagus</i>, then of <i>comitatus</i>, or countship
of Anjou. This countship, the extent of which seems to
have been practically identical with that of the ecclesiastical
diocese of Angers, occupied the greater part of what is now the
department of Maine-et-Loire, further embracing, to the north,
Craon, Bazouges (Château-Gontier), Le Lude, and to the east,
Château-la-Vallière and Bourgueil, while to the south, on the
other hand, it included neither the present town of Montreuil-Bellay,
nor Vihiers, Cholet, Beaupréau, nor the whole district
lying to the west of the Ironne and Thouet, on the left bank of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page56" id="page56"></a>56</span>
the Loire, which formed the territory of the Mauges. It was
bounded on the north by the countship of Maine, on the east
by that of Touraine, on the south by that of Poitiers and by
the Mauges, on the west by the countship of Nantes.</p>

<p>From the outset of the reign of Charles the Bald, the integrity
of Anjou was seriously menaced by a two-fold danger: from
Brittany and from Normandy. Lambert, a former count of
Nantes, after devastating Anjou in concert with Nominoé, duke
of Brittany, had by the end of the year 851 succeeded in occupying
all the western part as far as the Mayenne. The principality,
which he thus carved out for himself, was occupied, on his death,
by Erispoé, duke of Brittany; by him it was handed down to
his successors, in whose hands it remained till the beginning
of the 10th century. All this time the Normans had not ceased
ravaging the country; a brave man was needed to defend it,
and finally towards 861, Charles the Bald entrusted it to Robert
the Strong (<i>q.v.</i>), but he unfortunately met with his death in
866 in a battle against the Normans at Brissarthe. Hugh
the Abbot succeeded him in the countship of Anjou as in most
of his other duties, and on his death (886) it passed to Odo (<i>q.v.</i>),
the eldest son of Robert the Strong, who, on his accession to
the throne of France (888), probably handed it over to his brother
Robert. In any case, during the last years of the 9th century,
in Anjou as elsewhere the power was delegated to a viscount,
Fulk the Red (mentioned under this title after 898), son of a
certain Ingelgerius.</p>

<p>In the second quarter of the 10th century Fulk the Red
had already usurped the title of count, which his descendants
kept for three centuries. He was succeeded first by his son
Fulk II. the Good (941 or 942-<i>c.</i> 960), and then by the son of
the latter, Geoffrey I. <i>Grisegonelle</i> (Greytunic) (<i>c.</i> 960-21st of
July 987), who inaugurated a policy of expansion, having as
its objects the extension of the boundaries of the ancient countship
and the reconquest of those parts of it which had been
annexed by the neighbouring states; for, though western Anjou
had been recovered from the dukes of Brittany since the beginning
of the 10th century, in the east all the district of Saumur
had already by that time fallen into the hands of the counts
of Blois and Tours. Geoffrey Greytunic succeeded in making
the count of Nantes his vassal, and in obtaining from the duke
of Aquitaine the concession in fief of the district of Loudun.
Moreover, in the wars of king Lothaire against the Normans
and against the emperor Otto II. he distinguished himself by
feats of arms which the epic poets were quick to celebrate. His
son Fulk III. Nerra (<i>q.v.</i>) (21st of July 987-21st of June 1040)
found himself confronted on his accession with a coalition of
Odo I., count of Blois, and Conan I., count of Rennes. The latter
having seized upon Nantes, of which the counts of Anjou held
themselves to be suzerains, Fulk Nerra came and laid siege to it,
routing Conan&rsquo;s army at Conquereuil (27th of June 992) and
re-establishing Nantes under his own suzerainty. Then turning
his attention to the count of Blois, he proceeded to establish
a fortress at Langeais, a few miles from Tours, from which,
thanks to the intervention of the king Hugh Capet, Odo failed
to oust him. On the death of Odo I., Fulk seized Tours (996);
but King Robert the Pious turned against him and took the town
again (997). In 1016 a fresh struggle arose between Fulk and
Odo II., the new count of Blois. Odo II. was utterly defeated
at Pontlevoy (6th of July 1016), and a few years later, while
Odo was besieging Montboyau, Fulk surprised and took Saumur
(1026). Finally, the victory gained by Geoffrey Martel (<i>q.v.</i>)
(21st of June 1040-14th of November 1060), the son and successor
of Fulk, over Theobald III., count of Blois, at Nouy (21st of
August 1044), assured to the Angevins the possession of the
countship of Touraine. At the same time, continuing in this
quarter also the work of his father (who in 1025 took prisoner
Herbert Wake-Dog and only set him free on condition of his
doing him homage), Geoffrey succeeded in reducing the countship
of Maine to complete dependence on himself. During his father&rsquo;s
life-time he had been beaten by Gervais, bishop of Le Mans
(1038), but now (1047 or 1048) succeeded in taking the latter
prisoner, for which he was excommunicated by Pope Leo IX.
at the council of Reims (October 1049). In spite, however,
of the concerted attacks of William the Bastard (the Conqueror),
duke of Normandy, and Henry I., king of France, he was able
in 1051 to force Maine to recognize his authority, though failing
to revenge himself on William.</p>

<p>On the death of Geoffrey Martel (14th of November 1060) there
was a dispute as to the succession. Geoffrey Martel, having no
children, had bequeathed the countship to his eldest nephew,
Geoffrey III. the Bearded, son of Geoffrey, count of Gâtinais,
and of Ermengarde, daughter of Fulk Nerra. But Fulk le
Réchin (the Cross-looking), brother of Geoffrey the Bearded,
who had at first been contented with an appanage consisting of
Saintonge and the <i>châtellenie</i> of Vihiers, having allowed Saintonge
to be taken in 1062 by the duke of Aquitaine, took advantage
of the general discontent aroused in the countship by the unskilful
policy of Geoffrey to make himself master of Saumur (25th of
February 1067) and Angers (4th of April), and cast Geoffrey
into prison at Sablé. Compelled by the papal authority to release
him after a short interval and to restore the countship to him,
he soon renewed the struggle, beat Geoffrey near Brissac and
shut him up in the castle of Chinon (1068). In order, however,
to obtain his recognition as count, Fulk IV. Réchin (1068-14th
of April 1109) had to carry on a long struggle with his barons,
to cede Gâtinais to King Philip I., and to do homage to the count
of Blois for Touraine. On the other hand, he was successful
on the whole in pursuing the policy of Geoffrey Martel in Maine:
after destroying La Flèche, by the peace of Blanchelande (1081),
he received the homage of Robert &ldquo;Courteheuse&rdquo; (&ldquo;Curthose&rdquo;),
son of William the Conqueror, for Maine. Later, he upheld Elias,
lord of La Flèche, against William Rufus, king of England,
and on the recognition of Elias as count of Maine in 1100,
obtained for Fulk the Young, his son by Bertrade de Montfort,
the hand of Eremburge, Elias&rsquo;s daughter and sole heiress.</p>

<p>Fulk V. the Young (14th of April 1109-1129) succeeded to the
countship of Maine on the death of Elias (11th of July 1110);
but this increase of Angevin territory came into such direct
collision with the interests of Henry I., king of England, who was
also duke of Normandy, that a struggle between the two powers
became inevitable. In 1112 it broke out, and Fulk, being unable
to prevent Henry I. from taking Alençon and making Robert,
lord of Bellême, prisoner, was forced, at the treaty of Pierre
Pecoulée, near Alençon (23rd of February 1113), to do homage
to Henry for Maine. In revenge for this, while Louis VI. was
overrunning the Vexin in 1118, he routed Henry&rsquo;s army at
Alençon (November), and in May 1119 Henry demanded a peace,
which was sealed in June by the marriage of his eldest son,
William the Aetheling, with Matilda, Fulk&rsquo;s daughter. William
the Aetheling having perished in the wreck of the &ldquo;White
Ship&rdquo; (25th of November 1120), Fulk, on his return from a
pilgrimage to the Holy Land (1120-1121), married his second
daughter Sibyl, at the instigation of Louis VI., to William Clito,
son of Robert Courteheuse, and a claimant to the duchy of
Normandy, giving her Maine for a dowry (1122 or 1123). Henry
I. managed to have the marriage annulled, on the plea of kinship
between the parties (1123 or 1124). But in 1127 a new alliance
was made, and on the 22nd of May at Rouen, Henry I. betrothed
his daughter Matilda, widow of the emperor Henry V., to
Geoffrey the Handsome, son of Fulk, the marriage being celebrated
at Le Mans on the 2nd of June 1129. Shortly after, on
the invitation of Baldwin II., king of Jerusalem, Fulk departed
to the Holy Land for good, married Melisinda, Baldwin&rsquo;s daughter
and heiress, and succeeded to the throne of Jerusalem (14th of
September 1131). His eldest son, Geoffrey IV. the Handsome
or &ldquo;Plantagenet,&rdquo; succeeded him as count of Anjou (1129-7th
of September 1151). From the first he tried to profit by his
marriage, and after the death of Henry I. (1st of December 1135),
laid the foundation of the conquest of Normandy by a series of
campaigns: about the end of 1135 or the beginning of 1136 he
entered that country and rejoined his wife, the countess Matilda,
who had received the submission of Argentan, Domfront and
Exmes. Having been abruptly recalled into Anjou by a revolt
of his barons, he returned to the charge in September 1136 with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>57</span>
strong army, including in its ranks William, duke of Aquitaine,
Geoffrey, count of Vendôme, and William Talvas, count of
Ponthieu, but after a few successes was wounded in the foot at
the siege of Le Sap (October 1) and had to fall back. In May
1137 began a fresh campaign in which he devastated the district
of Hiémois (round Exmes) and burnt Bazoches. In June 1138,
with the aid of Robert of Gloucester, Geoffrey obtained the
submission of Bayeux and Caen; in October he devastated the
neighbourhood of Falaise; finally, in March 1141, on hearing of
his wife&rsquo;s success in England, he again entered Normandy, when
he made a triumphal procession through the country. Town
after town surrendered: in 1141, Verneuil, Nonancourt, Lisieux,
Falaise; in 1142, Mortain, Saint-Hilaire, Pontorson; in 1143,
Avranches, Saint-Lô, Cérences, Coutances, Cherbourg; in the
beginning of 1144 he entered Rouen, and on the 19th of January
received the ducal crown in its cathedral. Finally, in 1149, after
crushing a last attempt at revolt, he handed over the duchy to
his son Henry &ldquo;Curtmantel,&rdquo; who received the investiture at the
hands of the king of France.</p>

<p>All the while that Fulk the Young and Geoffrey the Handsome
were carrying on the work of extending the countship of Anjou,
they did not neglect to strengthen their authority at home, to
which the unruliness of the barons was a menace. As regards
Fulk the Young we know only a few isolated facts and dates:
about 1109 Doué and L&rsquo;Île Bouchard were taken; in 1112
Brissac was besieged, and about the same time Eschivard of
Preuilly subdued; in 1114 there was a general war against the
barons who were in revolt, and in 1118 a fresh rising, which was
put down after the siege of Montbazon: in 1123 the lord of Doué
revolted, and in 1124 Montreuil-Bellay was taken after a siege
of nine weeks. Geoffrey the Handsome, with his indefatigable
energy, was eminently fitted to suppress the coalitions of his
vassals, the most formidable of which was formed in 1129.
Among those who revolted were Guy of Laval, Giraud of Montreuil-Bellay,
the viscount of Thouars, the lords of Mirebeau,
Amboise, Partbenay and Sablé. Geoffrey succeeded in beating
them one after another, razed the keep of Thouars and occupied
Mirebeau. Another rising was crushed in 1134 by the destruction
of Cand and the taking of L&rsquo;Île Bouchard. In 1136, while the
count was in Normandy, Robert of Sable put himself at the head
of the movement, to which Geoffrey responded by destroying
Briollay and occupying La Suze, and Robert of Sable himself
was forced to beg humbly for pardon through the intercession of
the bishop of Angers. In 1139 Geoffrey took Mirebeau, and in
1142 Champtoceaux, but in 1145 a new revolt broke out, this
time under the leadership of Elias, the count&rsquo;s own brother,
who, again with the assistance of Robert of Sable, laid claim to
the countship of Maine. Geoffrey took Elias prisoner, forced
Robert of Sable to beat a retreat, and reduced the other barons
to reason. In 1147 he destroyed Doue and Blaison. Finally
in 1150 he was checked by the revolt of Giraud, lord of
Montreuil-Bellay: for a year he besieged the place till it had to
surrender: he then took Giraud prisoner and only released him
on the mediation of the king of France.</p>

<p>Thus, on the death of Geoffrey the Handsome (7th of September
1151), his son Henry found himself heir to a great
empire, strong and consolidated, to which his marriage with
Eleanor of Aquitaine (May 1152) further added Aquitaine.</p>

<p>At length on the death of King Stephen, Henry was recognised
as king of England (19th of December 1154). But then his
brother Geoffrey, who had received as appanage the three
fortresses of Chinon, Loudun and Mirebeau, tried to seize upon
Anjou, on the pretext that, by the will of their father, Geoffrey
the Handsome, all the paternal inheritance ought to descend to
him, if Henry succeeded in obtaining possession of the maternal
inheritance. On hearing of this, Henry, although he had sworn
to observe this will, had himself released from his oath by the
pope, and hurriedly marched against his brother, from whom in
the beginning of 1156 he succeeded in taking Chinon and Mirebeau;
and in July he forced Geoffrey to give up even his three
fortresses in return for an annual pension. Henceforward Henry
succeeded in keeping the countship of Anjou all his life; for
though he granted it in 1168 to his son Henry &ldquo;of the Short
Mantle,&rdquo; when the latter became old enough to govern it, he
absolutely refused to allow him to enjoy his power. After
Henry II.&rsquo;s death in 1189 the countship, together with the rest
of his dominions, passed to his son Richard I. of England, but
on the death of the latter in 1199, Arthur of Brittany (born in
1187) laid claim to the inheritance, which ought, according to
him, to have fallen to his father Geoffrey, fourth son of Henry II.,
in accordance with the custom by which &ldquo;the son of the eldest
brother should succeed to his father&rsquo;s patrimony.&rdquo; He therefore
set himself up in rivalry with John Lackland, youngest son of
Henry II., and supported by Philip Augustus of France, and
aided by William des Roches, seneschal of Anjou, he managed
to enter Angers (18th of April 1199) and there have himself
recognized as count of the three countships of Anjou, Maine and
Touraine, for which he did homage to the king of France. King
John soon regained the upper hand, for Philip Augustus having
deserted Arthur by the treaty of Le Goulet (22nd of May 1200),
John made his way into Anjou; and on the 18th of June 1200
was recognized as count at Angers. In 1202 he refused to do
homage to Philip Augustus, who, in consequence, confiscated
all his continental possessions, including Anjou, which was
allotted by the king of France to Arthur. The defeat of the
latter, who was taken prisoner at Mirebeau on the ist of August
1202, seemed to ensure John&rsquo;s success, but he was abandoned
by William des Roches, who in 1203 assisted Philip Augustus in
subduing the whole of Anjou. A last effort on the part of John
to possess himself of it, in 1214, led to the taking of Angers (17th
of June), but broke down lamentably at the battle of La Roche-aux-Moines
(2nd of July), and the countship was attached to the
crown of France.</p>

<p>Shortly afterwards it was separated from it again, when in
August 1246 King Louis IX. gave it as an appanage to his son
Charles, count of Provence, soon to become king of Naples and
Sicily (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Naples</a></span>). Charles I. of Anjou, engrossed with his other
dominions, gave little thought to Anjou, nor did his son Charles II.
the Lame, who succeeded him on the 7th of January 1285. On
the 16th of August 1290, the latter married his daughter Margaret
to Charles of Valois, son of Philip III. the Bold, giving her Anjou
and Maine for dowry, in exchange for the kingdoms of Aragon
and Valentia and the countship of Barcelona given up by Charles.
Charles of Valois at once entered into possession of the countship
of Anjou, to which Philip IV. the Fair, in September 1297,
attached a peerage of France. On the 16th of December 1325,
Charles died, leaving Anjou to his eldest son Philip of Valois,
on whose recognition as king of France (Philip VI.) on the 1st of
April 1328, the countship of Anjou was again united to the crown.
On the 17th of February 1332, Philip VI. bestowed it on his son
John the Good, who, when he became king in turn (22nd of
August 1350), gave the countship to his second son Louis I.,
raising it to a duchy in the peerage of France by letters patent
of the 25th of October 1360. Louis I., who became in time
count of Provence and king of Naples (see Louis I., king of Naples,)
died in 1384, and was succeeded by his son Louis II., who devoted
most of his energies to his kingdom of Naples, and left the administration
of Anjou almost entirely in the hands of his wife,
Yolande of Aragon. On his death (29th of April 1417) she took
upon herself the guardianship of their young son Louis III.,
and in her capacity of regent defended the duchy against the
English. Louis III., who also succeeded his father as king of
Naples, died on the 15th of November 1434, leaving no children.
The duchy of Anjou then passed to his cousin René, second son
of Louis II. and Yolande of Aragon, and king of Naples and
Sicily (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Naples</a></span>).</p>

<p>Unlike his predecessors, who had rarely stayed long in Anjou,
René from 1443 onwards paid long visits to it, and his court at
Angers became one of the most brilliant in the kingdom of
France. But after the sudden death of his son John in December
1470, Rene, for reasons which are not altogether clear, decided
to move his residence to Provence and leave Anjou for good.
After making an inventory of all his possessions, he left the duchy
in October 1471, taking with him the most valuable of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page58" id="page58"></a>58</span>
treasures. On the 22nd of July 1474 he drew up a will by which
he divided the succession between his grandson René II. of
Lorraine and his nephew Charles II., count of Maine. On hearing
this, King Louis XI., who was the son of one of King René&rsquo;s
sisters, seeing that his expectations were thus completely
frustrated, seized the duchy of Anjou. He did not keep it very
long, but became reconciled to René in 1476 and restored it to
him, on condition, probably, that René should bequeath it to
him. However that may be, on the death of the latter (10th
of July 1480) he again added Anjou to the royal domain.</p>

<p>Later, King Francis I. again gave the duchy as an appanage
to his mother, Louise of Savoy, by letters patent of the 4th of
February 1515. On her death, in September 1531, the duchy
returned into the king&rsquo;s possession. In 1552 it was given as
an appanage by Henry II. to his son Henry of Valois, who, on
becoming king in 1574, with the title of Henry III., conceded it
to his brother Francis, duke of Alençon, at the treaty of Beaulieu
near Loches (6th of May 1576). Francis died on the 10th of June
1584, and the vacant appanage definitively became part of the
royal domain.</p>

<p>At first Anjou was included in the <i>gouvernement</i> (or military
command) of Orléanais, but in the 17th century was made into
a separate one. Saumur, however, and the Saumurois, for which
King Henry IV. had in 1589 created an independent military
governor-generalship in favour of Duplessis-Mornay, continued
till the Revolution to form a separate <i>gouvernement</i>, which included,
besides Anjou, portions of Poitou and Mirebalais.
Attached to the <i>généralité</i> (administrative circumscription) of
Tours, Anjou on the eve of the Revolution comprised five
<i>êlections</i> (judicial districts):&mdash;Angers, Beaugé, Saumur, Château-Gontier,
Montreuil-Bellay and part of the <i>êlections</i> of La Flèche
and Richelieu. Financially it formed part of the so-called <i>pays
de grande gabelle</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Gabelle</a></span>), and comprised sixteen special
tribunals, or <i>greniers à sel</i> (salt warehouses):&mdash;Angers, Beaugé,
Beaufort, Bourgueil, Candé, Château-Gontier, Cholet, Craon,
La Flèche, Saint-Florent-le-Vieil, Ingrandes, Le Lude, Pouancé,
Saint-Remy-la-Varenne, Richelieu, Saumur. From the point
of view of purely judicial administration, Anjou was subject
to the parlement of Paris; Angers was the seat of a presidial
court, of which the jurisdiction comprised the <i>sénéchaussées</i>
of Angers, Saumur, Beaugé, Beaufort and the duchy of Richelieu;
there were besides presidial courts at Château-Gontier and La
Flèche. When the Constituent Assembly, on the 26th of
February 1790, decreed the division of France into departments,
Anjou and the Saumurois, with the exception of certain territories,
formed the department of Maine-et-Loire, as at present constituted.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Authorities</span>.&mdash;(1) <i>Principal Sources</i>: The history of Anjou may
be told partly with the aid of the chroniclers of the neighbouring
provinces, especially those of Normandy (William of Poitiers,
William of Jumièges, Ordericus Vitalis) and of Maine (especially
<i>Actus pontificum Cenomannis in urbe degentium</i>). For the 10th,
11th and 12th centuries especially, there are some important texts
dealing entirely with Anjou. The most important is the chronicle
called <i>Gesta consulum Andegavorum</i>, of which only a poor edition
exists (<i>Chroniques des comtes d&rsquo;Anjou</i>, published by Marchegay and
Salmon, with an introduction by E. Mabille, Paris, 1856-1871,
collection of the <i>Société de l&rsquo;histoire de France</i>). See also with reference
to this text Louis Halphen, <i>Êtude sur les chroniques des comtes
d&rsquo;Anjou et des seigneurs d&rsquo;Amboise</i> (Paris, 1906). The above may be
supplemented by some valuable annals published by Louis Halphen,
<i>Recueil d&rsquo;annales angevines et vendómoises</i> (Paris, 1903), (in the
series <i>Collection de textes pour servir à l&rsquo;étude et à l&rsquo;enseignement de
l&rsquo;histoire</i>). For further details see Auguste Molinier, <i>Les Sources de
l&rsquo;histoire de France</i> (Paris, 1902), ii. 1276-1310, and the book of
Louis Halphen mentioned below.</p>

<p>(2) <i>Works</i>: The <i>Art de vérifier les dates</i> contains a history of
Anjou which is very much out of date, but has not been treated
elsewhere as a whole. The 11th century only has been treated in
detail by Louis Halphen, in <i>Le Comté d&rsquo;Anjou au XI<span class="sp">e</span> siècle</i> (Paris,
1906), which has a preface with bibliography and an introduction
dealing with the history of Anjou in the 10th century. For the 10th,
11th and 12th centuries, a good summary will be found in Kate
Norgate, <i>England under the Angevin Kings</i> (2 vols., London, 1887).
On René of Anjou, there is a book by A. Lecoy de la Marche, <i>Le Roi
René</i> (2 vols., Paris, 1875). Lastly, the work of Célestin Port,
<i>Dictionnaire historique, géographique et biographique de Maine-et-Loire</i>
(3 vols., Paris and Angers, 1874-1878), and its small volume of
<i>Préliminaires</i> (including a summary of the history of Anjou), contain,
in addition to the biographies of the chief counts of Anjou, a mass
of information concerning everything connected with Angevin
history.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANKERITE,<a name="ar3" id="ar3"></a></span> a member of the mineral group of rhombohedral
carbonates. In composition it is closely related to dolomite,
but differs from this in having magnesia replaced by varying
amounts of ferrous and manganous oxides, the general formula
being Ca(Mg, Fe, Mn)(CO<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">2</span>. Normal ankerite is Ca<span class="su">2</span>MgFe(CO<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">4</span>.
The crystallographic and physical characters resemble those
of dolomite and chalybite. The angle between the perfect
rhombohedral cleavages is 73° 48&prime;, the hardness 3½ to 4, and the
specific gravity 2.9 to 3.1; but these will vary slightly with the
chemical composition. The colour is white, grey or reddish.</p>

<p>Ankerite occurs with chalybite in deposits of iron-ore. It
is one of the minerals of the dolomite-chalybite series, to which
the terms brown-spar, pearl-spar and bitter-spar are loosely
applied. It was first recognized as a distinct species by W. von
Haidinger in 1825, and named by him after M.J. Anker of
Styria.</p>

province of Pomerania, on the Peene, 5 m. from its mouth in the
Kleines Haff, and 53 m. N.W. of Stettin, by the railway to
Stralsund. Pop. (1900) 14,602. The fortifications of Anklam
were dismantled in 1762 and have not since been restored, although
the old walls are still standing; formerly, however, it was
a town of considerable military importance, which suffered
severely during the Thirty Years&rsquo; and the Seven Years&rsquo; Wars;
and this fact, together with the repeated ravages of fire and of the
plague, has made its history more eventful than is usually the case
with towns of the same size. It does not possess any remarkable
buildings, although it contains several, private as well as public,
that are of a quaint and picturesque style of architecture. The
church of St Mary (12th century) has a modern tower, 335 ft.
high. The industries consist of iron-foundries and factories for
sugar and soap; and there is a military school. The Peene is
navigable up to the town, which has a considerable trade in its
own manufactures, as well as in the produce of the surrounding
country, while some shipbuilding is carried on in wharves on the
river.</p>

<p>Anklam, formerly Tanglim, was originally a Slav fortress; it
obtained civic rights in 1244 and joined the Hanseatic league. In
1648 it passed to Sweden, but in 1676 was retaken by Frederick
William I. of Brandenburg, and after being plundered by the
Russians in 1713 was ceded to Prussia by the peace of Stockholm
in 1720.</p>

crooked), a stiffness of a joint, the result of injury or disease. The
rigidity may be complete or partial and may be due to inflammation
of the tendinous or muscular structures outside the joint or
of the tissues of the joint itself. When the structures outside the
joint are affected, the term &ldquo;false&rdquo; ankylosis has been used in
contradistinction to &ldquo;true&rdquo; ankylosis, in which the disease is
within the joint. When inflammation has caused the joint-ends of
the bones to be fused together the ankylosis is termed <i>osseous</i> or
complete. Excision of a completely ankylosed shoulder or elbow
may restore free mobility and usefulness to the limb. &ldquo;Ankylosis&rdquo;
is also used as an anatomical term, bones being said to
ankylose (or anchylose) when, from being originally distinct, they
coalesce, or become so joined together that no motion can take
place between them.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANKYLOSTOMIASIS,<a name="ar8" id="ar8"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Anchylostomiasis</span> (also called

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>59</span>
a disease to which in recent years much attention has been
paid, from its prevalence in the mining industry in England,
France, Germany, Belgium, North Queensland and elsewhere.
This disease (apparently known in Egypt even in very ancient
times) caused a great mortality among the negroes in the West
Indies towards the end of the 18th century; and through
descriptions sent from Brazil and various other tropical and
sub-tropical regions, it was subsequently identified, chiefly
through the labours of Bilharz and Griesinger in Egypt (1854), as
being due to the presence in the intestine of nematoid worms
(<i>Ankylostoma duodenalis</i>) from one-third to half an inch long. The
symptoms, as first observed among the negroes, were pain in the
stomach, capricious appetite, pica (or dirt-eating), obstinate
constipation followed by diarrhoea, palpitations, small and
unsteady pulse, coldness of the skin, pallor of the skin and mucous
membranes, diminution of the secretions, loss of strength and,
in cases running a fatal course, dysentery, haemorrhages and
dropsies. The parasites, which cling to the intestinal mucous
membrane, draw their nourishment from the blood-vessels of
their host, and as they are found in hundreds in the body after
death, the disorders of digestion, the increasing anaemia and the
consequent dropsies and other cachectic symptoms are easily
explained. The disease was first known in Europe among the
Italian workmen employed on the St Gotthard tunnel. In 1896,
though previously unreported in Germany, 107 cases were
registered there, and the number rose to 295 in 1900, and 1030 in
1901. In England an outbreak at the Dolcoath mine, Cornwall,
in 1902, led to an investigation for the home office by Dr Haldane
F.R.S. (see especially the Parliamentary Paper, numbered Cd.
1843), and since then discussions and inquiries have been frequent.
A committee of the British Association in 1904 issued a valuable
report on the subject. After the Spanish-American War American
physicians had also given it their attention, with valuable results;
see Stiles (<i>Hygienic Laboratory Bulletin</i>, No. 10, Washington,
1903). The American parasite described by Stiles, and called
<i>Uncinaria americana</i> (whence the name Uncinariasis for this
disease) differs slightly from the Ankylostoma. The parasites
thrive in an environment of dirt, and the main lines of precaution
are those dictated by sanitary science. Malefern, santonine,
thymol and other anthelmintic remedies are prescribed.</p>

about 1560, and is said to have been of Flemish descent. The date
of his death is uncertain, but he seems to have been alive in 1639.
For a number of years he studied under Leonardo Corona, and on
the death of that painter completed several works left unfinished
by him. His own activity seems to have been confined to the
production of pieces for several of the churches and a few private
houses in Venice, and the old guide-books and descriptions of the

leaving her regent for their infant son, Charles Augustus. During
the protracted minority she administered the affairs of the
duchy with the greatest prudence, strengthening its resources
and improving its position in spite of the troubles of the Seven
Years&rsquo; War. She was a patroness of art and literature, and
attracted to Weimar many of the most eminent men in Germany.
Wieland was appointed tutor to her son; and the names of
Herder, Goethe and Schiller shed an undying lustre on her court.
In 1775 she retired into private life, her son having attained his
majority. In 1788 she set out on a lengthened tour through
Italy, accompanied by Goethe. She died on the 10th of April

chief seat of the braid and lace-making industry in Germany,
introduced here by Barbara Uttmann in 1561, and further
developed by Belgian refugees, who, driven from their country
by the duke of Alva, settled here in 1590. The mining industry,

<p><span class="bold">ANNA COMNENA,<a name="ar14" id="ar14"></a></span> daughter of the emperor Alexius I.
Comnenus, the first woman historian, was born on the 1st of
December 1083. She was her father&rsquo;s favourite and was carefully
trained in the study of poetry, science and Greek philosophy.
But, though learned and studious, she was intriguing and
ambitious, and ready to go to any lengths to gratify her longing
for power. Having married an accomplished young nobleman,
Nicephorus Bryennius, she united with the empress Irene in
a vain attempt to prevail upon her father during his last illness
to disinherit his son and give the crown to her husband. Still
undeterred, she entered into a conspiracy to depose her brother
after his accession; and when her husband refused to join in the
enterprise, she exclaimed that &ldquo;nature had mistaken their
sexes, for he ought to have been the woman.&rdquo; The plot being
discovered, Anna forfeited her property and fortune, though, by
the clemency of her brother, she escaped with her life. Shortly
afterwards, she retired into a convent and employed her leisure
in writing the <i>Alexiad</i>&mdash;a history, in Greek, of her father&rsquo;s life
and reign (1081-1118), supplementing the historical work of her
husband. It is rather a family panegyric than a scientific history,
in which the affection of the daughter and the vanity of the
author stand out prominently. Trifling acts of her father are
described at length in exaggerated terms, while little notice is
taken of important constitutional matters. A determined
opponent of the Latin church and an enthusiastic admirer of the
Byzantine empire, Anna Comnena regards the Crusades as a
danger both political and religious. Her models are Thucydides,
Polybius and Xenophon, and her style exhibits the striving after
Atticism characteristic of the period, with the result that the
language is highly artificial. Her chronology especially is defective.</p>

(1718-1746), regent of Russia for a few months during the
minority of her son Ivan, was the daughter of Catherine, sister
of the empress Anne, and Charles Leopold, duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin.
In 1739 she married Anton Ulrich (d. 1775), son of
Ferdinand Albert, duke of Brunswick, and their son Ivan was
adopted in 1740 by the empress and proclaimed heir to the
Russian throne. A few days after this proclamation the empress
died, leaving directions regarding the succession, and appointing
her favourite Ernest Biren, duke of Courland, as regent. Biren,
however, had made himself an object of detestation to the
Russian people, and Anna had little difficulty in overthrowing
his power. She then assumed the regency, and took the title of
grand-duchess, but she knew little of the character of the people
with whom she had to deal, was utterly ignorant of the approved
Russian mode of government, and speedily quarrelled with her
principal supporters. In December 1741, Elizabeth, daughter
of Peter the Great, who, from her habits, was a favourite with
the soldiers, excited the guards to revolt, overcame the slight
opposition that was offered, and was proclaimed empress. Ivan
was thrown into prison, where he soon afterwards perished.
Anna and her husband were banished to a small island in the
river Dvina, where on the 18th of March 1746 she died in
childbed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANNALISTS<a name="ar16" id="ar16"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>annus</i>, year; hence <i>annales</i>, sc.
<i>libri</i>, annual records), the name given to a class of writers on
Roman history, the period of whose literary activity lasted from
the time of the Second Punic War to that of Sulla. They wrote
the history of Rome from the earliest times (in most cases) down
to their own days, the events of which were treated in much
greater detail. For the earlier period their authorities were
state and family records&mdash;above all, the <i>annales maximi</i> (or
<i>annales pontificum</i>), the official chronicle of Rome, in which the
notable occurrences of each year from the foundation of the city
were set down by the pontifex maximus. Although these annals
were no doubt destroyed at the time of the burning of Rome by
the Gauls, they were restored as far as possible and continued
until the pontificate of P. Mucius Scaevola, by whom they were
finally published in eighty books. Two generations of these
annalists have been distinguished&mdash;an older and a younger.
The older, which extends to 150 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, set forth, in bald, unattractive
language, without any pretensions to style, but with
a certain amount of trustworthiness, the most important events
of each successive year. Cicero (<i>De Oratore</i>, ii. 12. 53), comparing
these writers with the old Ionic logographers, says that they
paid no attention to ornament, and considered the only merits
of a writer to be intelligibility and conciseness. Their annals
were a mere compilation of facts. The younger generation, in
view of the requirements and criticism of a reading public,
cultivated the art of composition and rhetorical embellishment.
As a general rule the annalists wrote in a spirit of uncritical
patriotism, which led them to minimize or gloss over such
disasters as the conquest of Rome by Porsena and the compulsory
payment of ransom to the Gauls, and to flatter the people by
exaggerated accounts of Roman prowess, dressed up in fanciful
language. At first they wrote in Greek, partly because a national
style was not yet formed, and partly because Greek was the
fashionable language amongst the educated, although Latin
versions were probably published as well. The first of the
annalists, the father of Roman history, as he has been called,
was <span class="sc">Q. Fabius Pictor</span> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fabius Pictor</a></span>); contemporary
with him was <span class="sc">L. Cincius Alimentus</span>, who flourished during
the Hannibalic war.<a name="fa1a" id="fa1a" href="#ft1a"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Like Fabius Pictor, he wrote in Greek.
He was taken prisoner by Hannibal (Livy xxi. 38), who is said
to have given him details of the crossing of the Alps. His work
embraced the history of Rome from its foundation down to his
own days. With <span class="sc">M. Porcius Cato</span> (<i>q.v.</i>) historical composition
in Latin began, and a livelier interest was awakened in the
history of Rome. Among the principal writers of this class who
succeeded Cato, the following may be mentioned. L. <span class="sc">Cassius
Hemina</span> (about 146), in the fourth book of his Annals, wrote on
the Second Punic War. His researches went back to very early
times; Pliny (<i>Nat. Hist</i>. xiii. 13 [27]) calls him <i>vetustissimus
auctor annalium</i>. <span class="sc">L. Calpufnius</span> Piso, surnamed <i>Frugi</i> (see
under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Piso</a></span>), wrote seven books of annals, relating the history
of the city from its foundation down to his own times. Livy
regards him as a less trustworthy authority than Fabius Pictor,
and Niebuhr considers him the first to introduce systematic
forgeries into Roman history. <span class="sc">Q. Claudius Quadrigarius</span>
(about 80 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) wrote a history, in at least twenty-three books,
which began with the conquest of Rome by the Gauls and went
down to the death of Sulla or perhaps later. He was freely used
by Livy in part of his work (from the sixth book onwards). A
long fragment is preserved in Aulus Gellius (ix. 13), giving an
account of the single combat between Manlius Torquatus and
the Gaul. His language was antiquated and his style dry, but
his work was considered important. <span class="sc">Valerius Antias</span>, a
younger contemporary of Quadrigarius, wrote the history of
Rome from the earliest times, in a voluminous work consisting
of seventy-five books. He is notorious for his wilful exaggeration,
both in narrative and numerical statements. For instance,
he asserts the number of the Sabine virgins to have been exactly
527; again, in a certain year when no Greek or Latin writers
mention any important campaign, Antias speaks of a big battle
with enormous casualties. Nevertheless, Livy at first made use
of him as one of his chief authorities, until he became convinced
of his untrustworthiness. <span class="sc">C. Licinius Macer</span> (died 66), who
has been called the last of the annalists, wrote a voluminous
work, which, although he paid great attention to the study of
his authorities, was too rhetorical, and exaggerated the achievements
of his own family. Having been convicted of extortion,
he committed suicide (Cicero, <i>De Legibus</i>, i. 2, <i>Brutus</i>, 67;
Plutarch, <i>Cicero</i>, 9).</p>

<p>The writers mentioned dealt with Roman history as a whole;
some of the annalists, however, confined themselves to shorter
periods. Thus, L. <span class="sc">Caelius Antipater</span> (about 120) limited
himself to the Second Punic War. His work was overloaded with
rhetorical embellishment, which he was the first to introduce
into Roman history. He was regarded as the most careful
writer on the war with Hannibal, and one who did not allow
himself to be blinded by partiality in considering the evidence
of other writers (Cicero, <i>De Oratore</i>, ii. 12). Livy made great
use of him in his third decade. <span class="sc">Sempronius Asellio</span> (about
100 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), military tribune of Scipio Africanus at the siege of
Numantia, composed <i>Rerum Gestanim Libri</i> in at least fourteen
books. As he himself took part in the events he describes, his
work was a kind of memoirs. He was the first of his class who
endeavoured to trace the causes of events, instead of contenting
himself with a bare statement of facts. L. <span class="sc">Cornelius Sisenna</span>
(119-67), legate of Pompey in the war against the pirates, lost
his life in an expedition against Crete. He wrote twenty-three
books on the period between the Social War and the dictatorship
of Sulla. His work was commended by Sallust (<i>Jugurtha</i>, 95),
who, however, blames him for not speaking out sufficiently.
Cicero remarks upon his fondness for archaisms (<i>Brutus</i>, 74.
259). Sisenna also translated the tales of Aristides of Miletus,
and is supposed by some to have written a ccmmentary on
Plautus. The autobiography of Sulla may also be mentioned.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANNALS<a name="ar17" id="ar17"></a></span> (<i>Annales</i>, from <i>annus</i>, a year), a concise historical
record in which events are arranged chronologically, year by
year. The chief sources of information in regard to the annals
of ancient Rome are two passages in Cicero (<i>De Oratore</i>, ii. 12.
52) and in Servius (<i>ad Aen</i>. i. 373) which have been the subject
of much discussion. Cicero states that from the earliest period
down to the pontificate of Publius Mucius Scaevola (<i>c.</i> 131 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>),
it was usual for the pontifex maximus to record on a white tablet
(<i>album</i>), which was exhibited in an open place at his house, so
that the people might read it, first, the name of the consuls and
other magistrates, and then the noteworthy events that had
occurred during the year (<i>per singulos dies</i>, as Servius says).
These records were called in Cicero&rsquo;s time the <i>Annales Maximi</i>.
After the pontificate of Publius, the practice of compiling annals
was carried on by various unofficial writers, of whom Cicero
names Cato, Pictor and Piso. The <i>Annales</i> have been generally
regarded as the same with the <i>Commentarii Pontificum</i> cited by
Livy, but there seems reason to believe that the two were distinct,
the <i>Commentarii</i> being fuller and more circumstantial.
The nature of the distinction between annals and history is a
subject that has received more attention from critics than its
intrinsic importance deserves. The basis of discussion is furnished
chiefly by the above-quoted passage from Cicero, and by
the common division of the work of Tacitus into <i>Annales</i> and
<i>Hlstoriae</i>. Aulus Gellius, in the <i>Nodes Alticae</i> (v. 18), quotes the
grammarian Verrius Flaccus, to the effect that history, according
to its etymology (<span class="grk" title="istorein">&#7985;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#949;&#8150;&#957;</span>, <i>inspicere</i>, to inquire in person), is a
record of events that have come under the author&rsquo;s own observation,
while annals are a record of the events of earlier times
arranged according to years. This view of the distinction seems
to be borne out by the division of the work of Tacitus into the
<i>Historiae</i>, relating the events of his own time, and the <i>Annales</i>,
containing the history of earlier periods. It is more than
questionable, however, whether Tacitus himself divided his
work under these titles. The probability is, either that he called
the whole <i>Annales</i>, or that he used neither designation. (See
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tacitus</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Cornelius</a></span>.)</p>

<p>In the middle ages, when the order of the liturgical feasts was
partly determined by the date of Easter, the custom was early
established in the Western Church of drawing up tables to
indicate that date for a certain number of years or even
centuries. These Paschal tables were thin books in which each
annual date was separated from the next by a more or less considerable
blank space. In these spaces certain monks briefly
noted the important events of the year. It was at the end
of the 7th century and among the Anglo-Saxons that the
compiling of these Annals was first begun. Introduced by
missionaries on the continent, they were re-copied, augmented
and continued, especially in the kingdom of Austrasia. In the
9th century, during the great movement termed the Carolingian
Renaissance, these Annals became the usual form of contemporary
history; it suffices to mention the <i>Annales Einhardi</i>, the
<i>Annales Laureshamenses</i> (or &ldquo;of Lorsch&rdquo;), and the <i>Annales S.
Bertini</i>, officially compiled in order to preserve the memory of
the more interesting acts of Charlemagne, his ancestors and
his successors. Arrived at this stage of development, the
Annals now began to lose their primitive character, and
henceforward became more and more indistinguishable from the
Chronicles.</p>

<p>In modern literature the title annals has been given to a
large number of standard works which adhere more or less strictly
to the order of years. The best known are the <i>Annales Ecclesiastici</i>,
written by Cardinal Baronius as a rejoinder to and
refutation of the <i>Historia eccesiastica</i> or &ldquo;Centuries&rdquo; of the
Protestant theologians of Magdeburg (12 vols., published at
Rome from 1788 to 1793; Baronius&rsquo;s work stops at the year
1197). In the 19th century the annalistic form was once more
employed, either to preserve year by year the memory of passing
events (<i>Annual Register</i>, <i>Annuaire de la Revue des deux mondes</i>,
&amp;c.) or in writing the history of obscure medieval periods
(<i>Jahrbücher der deutschen Geschichte</i>, <i>Jahrbücher des deutschen
Reiches</i>, Richter&rsquo;s <i>Reichsannalen</i>, &amp;c.).</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANNAM,<a name="ar18" id="ar18"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Anam</span>, a country of south-eastern Asia, now
forming a French protectorate, part of the peninsula of Indo-China.
(See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indo-China, French</a></span>). It is bounded N. by Tongking,
E. and S.E. by the China Sea, S.W. by Cochin-China, and
W. by Cambodia and Laos. It comprises a sinuous strip of
territory measuring between 750 and 800 m. in length, with an
approximate area of 52,000 sq. m. The population is estimated
at about 6,124,000.</p>

<p>The country consists chiefly of a range of plateaus and wooded
mountains, running north and south and declining on the coast
to a narrow band of plain varying between 12 and 50 m. in
breadth. The mountains are cut transversely by short narrow
valleys, through which run rivers, most of which are dry in
summer and torrential in winter. The Song-Ma and the Song-Ca
in the north, and the Song-Ba, Don-Nai and Se-Bang-Khan in
the south, are alone of any size. The chief harbour is that afforded
by the bay of Tourane at the centre of the coast-line. South of
this point the coast curves outwards and is broken by peninsulas
and indentations; to the north it is concave and bordered in
many places by dunes and lagoons.</p>

<p><i>Climate.</i>&mdash;In Annam the rainy season begins during September
and lasts for three or four months, corresponding with the north-east
monsoon and also with a period of typhoons. During the
rains the temperature varies from 59 degrees or even lower to 75 degrees F.
June, July and August are the hottest months, the thermometer
often reaching 85 degrees or 90 degrees, though the heat of the day is to some
degree compensated by the freshness of the nights. The south-west
monsoon which brings rain in Cochin-China coincides with
the dry season in Annam, the reason probably being that the
mountains and lofty plateaus separating the two countries
retain the precipitation.</p>

<p><i>Ethnography</i>.&mdash;The Annamese, or, to use the native term, the
<i>Giao-chi</i>, are the predominant people not only in Annam but in
the lowland and cultivated parts of Tongking and in Cochin-China
and southern Cambodia. According to their own annals
and traditions they once inhabited southern China, a theory
which is confirmed by many of their habits and physical characteristics;
the race has, however, been modified by crossings with
the Chams and other of the previous inhabitants of Indo-China.</p>

<p>The Annamese is the worst-built and ugliest of all the Indo-Chinese
who belong to the Mongolian race. He is scarcely of
middle height and is shorter and less vigorous than his neighbours.
His complexion is tawny, darker than that of the Chinese, but
clearer than that of the Cambodian; his hair is black, coarse
and long; his skin is thick; his forehead low; his skull slightly
depressed at the top, but well developed at the sides. His face is
flat, with highly protruding cheek-bones, and is lozenge-shaped
or eurygnathous to a degree that is nowhere exceeded. His nose
is not only the flattest, but also the smallest among the Indo-Chinese;
his eyes are rarely oblique; his mouth is large and
his lips thick; his teeth are blackened and his gums destroyed
by the constant use of the betel-nut, the areca-nut and lime.
His neck is short, his shoulders slope greatly, his body is thick-set
and wanting in suppleness. Another peculiarity is a separation
of the big toe from the rest, greater than is found in any other
people, and sufficiently general and well marked to serve as an
ethnographic test. The Annamese of Cochin-China are weaker
and smaller than those of Tongking, probably as a result of
living amid marshy rice-fields. The Annamese of both sexes
wear wide trousers, a long, usually black tunic with narrow
sleeves and a dark-coloured turban, or in the case of the lower
classes, a wide straw hat; they either go bare-foot or wear sandals
or Chinese boots. The typical Annamese dwelling is open to the
gaze of the passer-by during the day; at night a sort of partition
of bamboo is let down. The roof is supported on wooden pillars
and walls are provided only at the sides. The house consists
principally of one large room opening on the front verandah
and containing the altar of the family&rsquo;s ancestors, a table in the
centre and couches placed against the wall. The chief elements
of the native diet are rice, fish and poultry; vegetables and pork
are also eaten. The family is the base of the social system
in Annam and is ruled by its head, who is also priest and judge.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>62</span>
Polygamy is permitted but rarely practised, and the wife enjoys
a position of some freedom.</p>

<p>Though fond of ease the Annamese are more industrious than
the neighbouring peoples. Theatrical and musical entertainments
are popular among them. They show much outward respect
for superiors and parents, but they are insincere and incapable
of deep emotion. They cherish great love of their native soil
and native village and cannot remain long from home. A
proneness to gambling and opium-smoking, and a tinge of vanity
and deceitfulness, are their less estimable traits. On the whole
they are mild and easy-going and even apathetic, but the
facility with which they learn is remarkable. Like their neighbours
the Cambodians and the Chinese, the Annamese have a great
respect for the dead, and ancestor worship constitutes the national
religion. The learned hold the doctrine of Confucius, and
Buddhism, alloyed with much popular superstition, has some
influence. Like the Chinese the Annamese bury their dead.</p>

<p>Among the savage tribes of the interior there is scarcely any
idea of God and their superstitious practices can scarcely be
considered as the expression of a definite religious idea. Roman
Catholics number about 420,000. In the midst of the Annamese
live Cambodians and immigrant Chinese, the latter associated
together according to the districts from which they come and
carrying on nearly all the commerce of the country. In the
forests and mountains dwell tribes of savages, chiefly of
Indonesian origin, classed by the Annamese under the name
<i>Moïs</i> or &ldquo;savages.&rdquo; Some of these tribes show traces of
Malay ancestry. Of greater historical interest are the Chams,
who are to be found for the most part in southern Annam and in
Cambodia, and who, judging from the numerous remains found
there, appear to have been the masters of the coast region of
Cochin-China and Annam till they succumbed before the pressure
of the Khmers of Cambodia and the Annamese. They are taller,
more muscular, and more supple than the Annamese. Their
language is derived from Malay, and while some of the Chams
are Mussulmans, the dominant religion is Brahmanism, and more
especially the worship of Siva. Their women have a high
reputation for virtue, which, combined with the general bright
and honest character of the whole people, differentiates them from
the surrounding nations.</p>

<p>Evidently derived from the Chinese, of which it appears to be
a very ancient dialect, the Annamese language is composed of
monosyllables, of slightly varied articulation, expressing different
ideas according to the tone in which they are pronounced. It is
quite impossible to connect with our musical system the utterance
of the sounds of which the Chinese and Annamese languages are
composed. What is understood by a &ldquo;tone&rdquo; in this language
is distinguished in reality, not by the number of sonorous
vibrations which belong to it, but rather by a use of the vocal
apparatus special to each. Thus, the sense will to a native be
completely changed according as the sound is the result of an
aspiration or of a simple utterance of the voice. Thence the
difficulty of substituting our phonetic alphabet for the ideographic
characters of the Chinese, as well as for the ideophonetic
writing partly borrowed by the Annamese from the letters of the
celestial empire. To the Jesuit missionaries is due the introduction
of an ingenious though very complicated system, which
has caused remarkable progress to be made in the employment of
phonetic characters. By means of six accents, one bar and a
crotchet it is possible to note with sufficient precision the indications
of tone without which the Annamese words have no sense
for the natives.</p>

<p><i>Agriculture and other Industries.</i>&mdash;The cultivation of rice,
which is grown mainly in the small deltas along the coast and
in some districts gives two crops annually, and fishing, together
with fish-salting and the preparation of nuoc-mam, a sauce
made from decaying fish, constitute the chief industries of
Annam.</p>

<p>Silk spinning and weaving are carried on on antiquated lines,
and silkworms are reared in a desultory fashion. Besides rice,
the products of the country include tea, tobacco, cotton, cinnamon,
precious woods and rubber; coffee, pepper, sugar-canes and
jute are cultivated to a minor extent. The exports (total value
in 1905 £237,010) comprise tea, raw silk and small quantities of
cotton, rice and sugar-cane. The imports (£284,824 in 1905)
include rice, iron goods, flour, wine, opium and cotton goods.
There are coal-mines at Nong-Son, near Tourane, and gold,
silver, lead, iron and other metals occur in the mountains.
Trade, which is in the hands of the Chinese, is for the most part
carried on by sea, the chief ports being Tourane and Qui-Nhon,
which are open to European commerce.</p>

<p><i>Administration.</i>&mdash;Annam is ruled in theory by its emperor,
assisted by the &ldquo;<i>comat</i>&rdquo; or secret council, composed of the heads
of the six ministerial departments of the interior, finance, war,
ritual, justice and public works, who are nominated by himself.
The resident superior, stationed at Hué, is the representative of
France and the virtual ruler of the country. He presides over
a council (<i>Conseil de Protectorat</i>) composed of the chiefs of the
French services in Annam, together with two members of the
&ldquo;<i>comat</i>&rdquo;; this body deliberates on questions of taxation affecting
the budget of Annam and on local public works. A native
governor (<i>tong-doc</i> or <i>tuan-phu</i>), assisted by a native staff,
administers each of the provinces into which the country is
divided, and native officials of lower rank govern the areas
into which these provinces are subdivided. The governors
take their orders from the imperial government, but they are
under the eye of French residents. Native officials are appointed
by the court, but the resident superior has power to annul an
appointment. The mandarinate or official class is recruited
from all ranks of the people by competitive examination. In
the province of Tourane, a French tribunal alone exercises
jurisdiction, but it administers native law where natives are
concerned. Outside this territory the native tribunals
survive. The Annamese village is self-governing. It has its
council of notables, forming a sort of oligarchy which,
through the medium of a mayor and two subordinates, directs
the interior affairs of the community&mdash;policing, recruiting, the
assignment and collection of taxes, &amp;c.&mdash;and has judicial power
in less important suits and crimes. More serious cases come
within the purview of the <i>an-sat</i>, a judicial auxiliary of the
governor. An assembly of notables from villages grouped
together in a canton chooses a cantonal representative, who is
the mouthpiece of the people and the intermediary between the
government and its subjects. The direct taxes, which go to the
local budget of Annam, consist primarily of a poll-tax levied
on all males over eighteen and below sixty years of age, and of
a land-tax levied according to the quality and the produce of the
holding.</p>

<p>The following table summarizes the local budget of Annam
for the years 1899 and 1904:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcc allb">&mdash;</td> <td class="tcc allb"><i>Receipts</i>.</td> <td class="tcc allb"><i>Expenditure</i>.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="tcc lb rb">1899</td> <td class="tcl rb">£203,082 (direct taxes, £171,160)</td> <td class="tcc rb">£175,117</td></tr>

</table>

<p>In 1904 the sum allocated to the expenses of the court, the
royal family and the native administration, the members of
which are paid by the crown, was £85,000, the chief remaining
heads of expenditure being the government house and residencies
(£39,709), the native guard (£32,609) and public works (£24,898).</p>

<p>Education is available to every person in the community.
The primary school, in which the pupils learn only Chinese
writing and the precepts of Confucius, stands at the base of this
system. Next above this is the school of the district capital,
where a half-yearly examination takes place, by means of which
are selected those eligible for the course of higher education
given at the capital of the province in a school under the direction
of a <i>doc-hoc</i>, or inspector of studies. Finally a great triennial
competition decides the elections. The candidate whose work
is notified as <i>très bien</i> is admitted to the examinations at Hué,
which qualify for the title of doctor and the holding of administrative
offices. The education of a mandarin includes local history,
cognizance of the administrative rites, customs, laws and
prescriptions of the country, the ethics of Confucius, the rules
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page63" id="page63"></a>63</span>
of good breeding, the ceremonial of official and social life,
and the practical acquirements necessary to the conduct of public
or private business. Annamese learning goes no farther. It
includes no scientific idea, no knowledge of the natural sciences,
and neglects even the most rudimentary instruction conveyed
in a European education. The complications of Chinese writing
greatly hamper education. The Annamese mandarin must be
acquainted with Chinese, since he writes in Chinese characters.
But the character being ideographic, the words which express
them are dissimilar in the two languages, and official text is
read in Chinese by a Chinese, in Annamese by an Annamese.</p>

<p>The chief towns of Annam are Hué (pop. about 42,000), seat
both of the French and native governments, Tourane (pop. about
4000), Phan-Thiet (pop. about 20,000) in the extreme south,
Qui-Nhon, and Fai-Fo, a commercial centre to the south of
Tourane. A road following the coast from Cochin-China to
Tongking, and known as the &ldquo;Mandarin road,&rdquo; passes through or
near the chief towns of the provinces and forms the chief artery
of communication in the country apart from the railways
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Indo-China, French</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The ancient tribe of the Giao-chi, who dwelt on
the confines of S. China, and in what is now Tongking and
northern Annam, are regarded by the Annamese as their
ancestors, and tradition ascribes to their first rulers descent
from the Chinese imperial family. These sovereigns were succeeded
by another dynasty, under which, at the end of the
3rd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, the Chinese invaded the country, and eventually
established there a supremacy destined to last, with little
intermission, till the 10th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> In 968 Dinh-Bo-Lanh
succeeded in ousting the Chinese and founded an independent
dynasty of Dinh. Till this period the greater part of Annam
had been occupied by the Chams, a nation of Hindu civilization,
which has left many monuments to testify to its greatness, but
the encroachment of the Annamese during the next six centuries
at last left to it only a small territory in the south of the country.
Three lines of sovereigns followed that of Dinh, under the last
of which, about 1407, Annam again fell under the Chinese yoke.
In 1428 an Annamese general Le-Loi succeeded in freeing the
country once more, and founded a dynasty which lasted till
the end of the 18th century. During the greater part of this
period, however, the titular sovereigns were mere puppets,
the reality of power being in the hands of the family of Trinh
in Tongking and that of Nguyen in southern Annam, which
in 1568 became a separate principality under the name of Cochin-China.
Towards the end of the 18th century a rebellion overthrew
the Nguyen, but one of its members, Gia-long, by the aid
of a French force, in 1801 acquired sway over the whole of Annam,
Tongking and Cochin-China. This force was procured for him
by Pigneau de Béhaine, bishop of Adran, who saw in the political
condition of Annam a means of establishing French influence
in Indo-China and counterbalancing the English power in India.
Before this, in 1787, Gia-long had concluded a treaty with
Louis XVI., whereby in return for a promise of aid he ceded
Tourane and Pulo-Condore to the French. That treaty marks
the beginning of French influence in Indo-China.</p>

Carlyle was a pupil. The river Annan is crossed by a stone bridge
of three arches dating from 1824, and by a railway bridge. The
Harbour Trust, constituted in 1897, improved the shipping
accommodation, and vessels of 300 tons approach close to the
town. The principal industries include cotton and rope manufactures,
bacon-curing, distilling, tanning, shipbuilding, sandstone
quarrying, nursery-gardening and salmon-fishing. Large
marine engineering works are in the vicinity. Annan is a burgh
of considerable antiquity. Roman remains exist in the neighbourhood,
and the Bruces, lords of Annandale, the Baliols, and the
Douglases were more or less closely associated with it. During
the period of the Border lawlessness the inhabitants suffered
repeatedly at the hands of moss-troopers and through the feuds of
rival families, in addition to the losses caused by the English and
Scots wars. Edward Irving was a native of the town. With
Dumfries, Kirkcudbright, Lochmaben and Sanquhar, Annan
unites in sending one meniber to parliament. Annan Hill commands
a beautiful prospect. Population (1901) 5805.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANNA PERENNA,<a name="ar20" id="ar20"></a></span> an old Roman deity of the circle or &ldquo;ring&rdquo;
of the year, as the name (<i>per annum</i>) clearly indicates. Her
festival fell on the full moon of the first month (March 15), and
was held at the grove of the goddess at the first milestone on the
Via Flaminia. It was much frequented by the city <i>plebs</i>, and
Ovid describes vividly the revelry and licentiousness of the
occasion (<i>Fasti</i>. iii. 523 foll.). From Macrobius we learn (<i>Sat</i>. i. 12.
6) that sacrifice was made to her &ldquo;ut annare perannareque commode
liccat,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> that the circle of the year may be completed
happily. This is all we know for certain about the goddess and
her cult; but the name naturally suggested myth-making, and
Anna became a figure in stories which may be read in Ovid (<i>l.c.</i>)
and in Silius Italicus (8.50 foll.). The coarse myth told by Ovid,
in which Anna plays a trick on Mars when in love with Minerva,
is probably an old Italian folk-tale, poetically applied to the
persons of these deities when they became partially anthropomorphized
under Greek influence.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANNAPOLIS,<a name="ar21" id="ar21"></a></span> a city and seaport of Maryland, U.S.A., the
capital of the state, the county seat of Anne Arundel county, and
the seat of the United States Naval Academy; situated on the
Severn river about 2 m. from its entrance into Chesapeake Bay,
26 m. S. by E. from Baltimore and about the same distance E. by
N. from Washington. Pop. (1890) 7604; (1900) 8525, of whom
3002 were negroes; (1910 census) 8609. Annapolis is served
by the Washington, Baltimore &amp; Annapolis (electric) and the
Maryland Electric railways, and by the Baltimore &amp; Annapolis
steamship line. On an elevation near the centre of the city stands
the state house (the corner stone of which was laid in 1772), with
its lofty white dome (200 ft.) and pillared portico. Close by are
the state treasury building, erected late in the 17th century for
the House of Delegates; Saint Anne&rsquo;s Protestant Episcopal
church, in later colonial days a state church, a statue of Roger B.
Taney (by W.H. Rinehart), and a statue of Baron Johann de Kalb.
There are a number of residences of 18th century architecture, and
the names of several of the streets&mdash;such as King George&rsquo;s, Prince
George&rsquo;s, Hanover, and Duke of Gloucester&mdash;recall the colonial
days. The United States Naval Academy was founded here in
1845. Annapolis is the seat of Saint John&rsquo;s College, a non-sectarian
institution supported in part by the state; it was opened
in 1789 as the successor of King William&rsquo;s School, which was
founded by an act of the Maryland legislature in 1696 and was
opened in 1701. Its principal building, McDowell Hall, was
originally intended for a governor&rsquo;s mansion; although £4000
current money was appropriated for its erection in 1742, it was
not completed until after the War of Independence. In 1907 the
college became the school of arts and sciences of the university
of Maryland.</p>

<p>Annapolis, at first called Providence, was settled in 1649 by
Puritan exiles from Virginia. Later it bore in succession the
names of Town at Proctor&rsquo;s, Town at the Severn, Anne Arundel
Town, and finally in 1694, Annapolis, in honour of Princess Anne,
who at the time was heir to the throne of Great Britain. In 1694
also, soon after the overthrow of the Catholic government of the
lord proprietor, it was made the seat of the new government as
well as a port of entry, and it has since remained the capital of
Maryland; but it was not until 1708 that it was incorporated as
a city. From the middle of the 18th century until the War of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>64</span>
Independence, Annapolis was noted for its wealthy and cultivated
society. The <i>Maryland Gazette</i>, which became an important
weekly journal, was founded by Jonas Green in 1745; in 1769 a
theatre was opened; during this period also the commerce was
considerable, but declined rapidly after Baltimore, in 1780, was
made a port of entry, and now oyster-packing is the city&rsquo;s only important
industry. Congress was in session in the state house here
from the 26th of November 1783 to the 3rd of June 1784, and it
was here on the 23rd of December 1783 that General Washington
resigned his commission as commander-in-chief of the Continental
Army. In 1786 a convention, to which delegates from all the
states of the Union were invited, was called to meet in Annapolis
to consider measures for the better regulation of commerce (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Alexandria</a></span>, Va.); but delegates came from only five states
(New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, New Jersey, and Delaware),
and the convention&mdash;known afterward as the &ldquo;Annapolis Convention,&rdquo;&mdash;without
proceeding to the business for which it had
met, passed a resolution calling for another convention to meet
at Philadelphia in the following year to amend the articles of
confederation; by this Philadelphia convention the present
Constitution of the United States was framed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANNAPOLIS,<a name="ar22" id="ar22"></a></span> a town of Nova Scotia, capital of Annapolis
county and up to 1750 of the entire peninsula of Nova Scotia;
situated on an arm of the Bay of Fundy, at the mouth of the
Annapolis river, 95 m. W. of Halifax; and the terminus of the
Windsor &amp; Annapolis railway. Pop. (1901) 1019. It is one of
the oldest settlements in North America, having been founded in
1604 by the French, who called it Port Royal. It was captured
by the British in 1710, and ceded to them by the treaty of Utrecht
in 1713, when the name was changed in honour of Queen Anne.
It possesses a good harbour, and the beauty of the surrounding
country makes it a favourite summer resort. The town is

W. of Detroit. Pop. (1890) 9431; (1900) 14,509, of whom
2329 were foreign-born; (1910) 14,817. It is served by the
Michigan Central and the Ann Arbor railways, and by an
electric line running from Detroit to Jackson and connecting
with various other lines. Ann Arbor is best known as the seat of
the university of Michigan, opened in 1837. The city has many
attractive residences, and the residential districts, especially in
the east and south-east parts of the city, command picturesque
views of the Huron valley. Ann Arbor is situated in a productive
agricultural and fruit-growing region. The river provides good
water-power, and among the manufactures are agricultural
implements, carriages, furniture (including sectional book-cases),
pianos and organs, pottery and flour. In 1824 Ann Arbor was
settled, laid out as a town, chosen for the county-seat, and
named in honour of Mrs Ann Allen and Mrs Ann Rumsey, the
wives of two of the founders. It was incorporated as a village in
1833, and was first chartered as a city in 1851.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANNATES<a name="ar24" id="ar24"></a></span> (Lat. <i>annatae</i>, from <i>annus</i>, &ldquo;year&rdquo;), also known
as &ldquo;first-fruits&rdquo; (Lat. <i>primitiae</i>). in the strictest sense of the
word, the whole of the first year&rsquo;s profits of a spiritual benefice
which, in all countries of the Roman obedience, were formerly
paid into the papal treasury. This custom was only of gradual
growth. The <i>jus deportuum, annalia</i> or <i>annatae</i>, was originally
the right of the bishop to claim the first year&rsquo;s profits of the
living from a newly inducted incumbent, of which the first
mention is found under Pope Honorius (d. 1227), but which had
its origin in a custom, dating from the 6th century, by which
those ordained to ecclesiastical offices paid a fee or tax to the
ordaining bishop. The earliest records show the <i>annata</i> to have
been, sometimes a privilege conceded to the bishop for a term of
years, sometimes a right based on immemorial precedent. In
course of time the popes, under stress of financial crises, claimed
the privilege for themselves, though at first only temporarily.
Thus, in 1305, Clement V. claimed the first-fruits of all vacant
benefices in England, and in 1319 John XXII. those of all
Christendom vacated within the next two years. In those cases
the rights of the bishops were frankly usurped by the Holy See,
now regarded as the ultimate source of the episcopal jurisdiction;
the more usual custom was for the pope to claim the
first-fruits only of those benefices of which he had reserved the
patronage to himself. It was from these claims that the papal
annates, in the strict sense, in course of time developed.</p>

<p>These annates may be divided broadly into three classes,
though the chief features are common to all: (1) the <i>servitia
communia</i> or <i>servitia Camerae Papae</i>, <i>i.e.</i> the payment into the
papal treasury by every abbot and bishop, on his induction, of
one year&rsquo;s revenue of his new benefice. The <i>servitia communia</i>
are traceable to the <i>oblatio</i> paid to the pope when consecrating
bishops as metropolitan or patriarch. When, in the middle of
the 13th century, the consecration of bishops became established
as the sole right of the pope, the oblations of all bishops of the
West were received by him and, by the close of the 14th century,
these became fixed at one year&rsquo;s revenue.<a name="fa1b" id="fa1b" href="#ft1b"><span class="sp">1</span></a> A small additional
payment, as a kind of notarial fee was added (<i>servitia minuta</i>).
(2) The <i>jus deportuum, fructus medii temporis</i>, or <i>annalia</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
the annates due to the bishop, but in the case of &ldquo;reserved&rdquo;
benefices paid by him to the Holy See. (3) The <i>quindennia, i.e.</i>
annates payable, under a bull of Paul II. (1469), by benefices
attached to a corporation, every fifteen years and not at every
presentation.</p>

<p>The system of annates was at no time worked with absolute
uniformity and completeness throughout the various parts of
the church owning obedience to the Holy See, and it was never
willingly submitted to by the clergy. Disagreements and disputes
were continual, and the easy expedient of rewarding the
officials of the Curia and increasing the papal revenue by &ldquo;reserving&rdquo;
more and more benefices was met by repeated protests,
such as that of the bishops and barons of England (the chief
sufferers), headed by Robert Grosseteste of Lincoln, at the council
of Lyons in 1245.<a name="fa2b" id="fa2b" href="#ft2b"><span class="sp">2</span></a> The subject, indeed, frequently became one
of national interest, on account of the alarming amount of specie
which was thus drained away, and hence numerous enactments
exist in regard to it by the various national governments. In
England the collection and payment of annates to the pope was
prohibited in 1531 by statute. At that time the sum amounted
to about 3000 pounds a year. In 1534 the annates were, along with the
supremacy over the church in England, bestowed on the crown;
but in February 1704 they were appropriated by Queen Anne to
the assistance of the poorer clergy, and thus form what has since
been known as &ldquo;Queen Anne&rsquo;s Bounty&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>). The amount to
be paid was originally regulated by a valuation made under the
direction of Pope Innocent IV. by Walter, bishop of Norwich, in
1254, later by one instituted under commission from Nicholas
III. in 1292, which in turn was superseded in 1535 by the valuation,
made by commissioners appointed by Henry VIII., known
as the <i>King&rsquo;s Books</i>, which was confirmed on the accession of
Elizabeth and is still that by which the clergy are rated. In
France, in spite of royal edicts&mdash;like those of Charles VI., Charles
VII., Louis XI, and Henry II.&mdash;and even denunciations of the
Sorbonne, at least the custom of paying the <i>servitia communia</i>
held its ground till the famous decree of the 4th of August during
the Revolution of 1789. In Germany it was decided by the
concordat of Constance, in 1418, that bishoprics and abbacies
should pay the <i>servitia</i> according to the valuation of the Roman
chancery in two half-yearly instalments. Those reserved benefices
only were to pay the <i>annalia</i> which were rated above twenty-four
gold florins; and as none were so rated, whatever their
annual value may have been, the annalia fell into disuse. A
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>65</span>
similar convenient fiction also led to their practical abrogation in
France, Spain and Belgium. The council of Basel (1431-1443)
wished to abolish the <i>servitia</i>, but the concordat of Vienna (1448)
confirmed the Constance decision, which, in spite of the efforts
of the congress of Ems (1786) to alter it, still remains nominally
in force. As a matter of fact, however, the revolution caused by
the secularization of the ecclesiastical states in 1803 practically
put an end to the system, and the <i>servitia</i> have either been
commuted <i>via gratiae</i> to a moderate fixed sum under particular
concordats, or are the subject of separate negotiation with each
bishop on his appointment. In Prussia, where the bishops
receive salaries as state officials, the payment is made by the
government.</p>

<p>In Scotland <i>annat</i> or <i>ann</i> is half a year&rsquo;s stipend allowed by
the Act 1672, <i>c</i>. 13, to the executors of a minister of the Church of
Scotland above what was due to him at the time of his death.
This is neither assignable by the clergyman during his life, nor
can it be seized by his creditors.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANNE<a name="ar25" id="ar25"></a></span> (1665-1714), queen of Great Britain and Ireland, second
daughter of James, duke of York, afterwards James II., and of
Anne Hyde, daughter of the ist earl of Clarendon, was born
on the 6th of February 1665. She suffered as a child from an
affection of the eyes, and was sent to France for medical treatment,
residing with her grandmother, Henrietta Maria, and on
the latter&rsquo;s death with her aunt, the duchess of Orleans, and
returning to England in 1670. She was brought up, together
with her sister Mary, by the direction of Charles II., as a strict
Protestant, and as a child she made the friendship of Sarah
Jennings (afterwards duchess of Marlborough), thus beginning
life under the two influences which were to prove the most
powerful in her future career. In 1678 she accompanied Mary of
Modena to Holland, and in 1679 joined her parents abroad and
afterwards in Scotland. On the 28th of July 1683 she married
Prince George of Denmark, brother of King Christian V., an
unpopular union because of the French proclivities of the
bridegroom&rsquo;s country, but one of great domestic happiness,
the prince and princess being conformable in temper and both
preferring retirement and quiet to life in the great world. Sarah
Churchill became Anne&rsquo;s lady of the bedchamber, and, by the
latter&rsquo;s desire to mark their mutual intimacy and affection, all
deference due to her rank was abandoned and the two ladies
called each other Mrs Morley and Mrs Freeman.</p>

<p>On the 6th of February 1685 James became king of England.
In 1687 a project of settling the crown on the princess, to the
exclusion of Mary, on the condition of Anne&rsquo;s embracing Roman
Catholicism, was rendered futile by her pronounced attachment
to the Church of England, and beyond sending her books and
papers James appears to have made no attempt to coerce his
daughter into a change of faith,<a name="fa1c" id="fa1c" href="#ft1c"><span class="sp">1</span></a> and to have treated her with
kindness, while the birth of his son on the 20th of June 1688
made the religion of his daughters a matter of less political
importance. Anne was not present on the occasion, having gone
to Bath, and this gave rise to a belief that the child was spurious;
but it is most probable that James&rsquo;s desire to exclude all
Protestants from affairs of state was the real cause. &ldquo;I shall never
now be satisfied,&rdquo; Anne wrote to Mary, &ldquo;whether the child be true
or false. It may be it is our brother, but God only knows ...
one cannot help having a thousand fears and melancholy thoughts,
but whatever changes may happen you shall ever find me firm
to my religion and faithfully yours.&rdquo;<a name="fa2c" id="fa2c" href="#ft2c"><span class="sp">2</span></a> In later years, however,
she had no doubt that the Old Pretender was her brother.
During the events immediately preceding the Revolution Anne
kept in seclusion. Her ultimate conduct was probably influenced
by the Churchills; and though forbidden by James, to pay Mary
a projected visit in the spring of 1688, she corresponded with her,
and was no doubt aware of William&rsquo;s plans. Her position was
now a very critical and painful one. She refused to show any
sympathy with the king after William had landed in November,
and wrote, with the advice of the Churchills, to the prince,
declaring her approval of his action.<a name="fa3c" id="fa3c" href="#ft3c"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Churchill abandoned the
king on the 24th, Prince George on the 25th, and when James
returned to London on the 26th he found that Anne and her
lady-in-waiting had during the previous night followed their
husbands&rsquo; examples. Escaping from Whitehall by a back
staircase they put themselves under the care of the bishop of
London, spent one night in his house, and subsequently arrived
on the 1st of December at Nottingham, where the princess first
made herself known and appointed a council. Thence she
passed through Leicester, Coventry and Warwick, finally entering
Oxford, where she met Prince George, in triumph, escorted by
a large company. Like Mary, she was reproached for showing
no concern at the news of the king&rsquo;s flight, but her justification
was that &ldquo;she never loved to do anything that looked like an
affected constraint.&rdquo; She returned to London on the 19th of
December, when she was at once visited by William. Subsequently
the Declaration of Rights settled the succession of the
crown upon her after William and Mary and their children.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Anne had suffered a series of maternal disappointments.
Between 1684 and 1688 she had miscarried four times
and given birth to two children who died infants. On the 24th
of July 1689, however, the birth, of a son, William, created duke
of Gloucester, who survived his infancy, gave hopes that heirs
to the throne under the Bill of Rights might be forthcoming.
But Anne&rsquo;s happiness was soon troubled by quarrels with the
king and queen. According to the duchess of Marlborough the
two sisters, who had lived hitherto while apart on extremely
affectionate terms, found no enjoyment in each other&rsquo;s society.
Mary talked too much for Anne&rsquo;s comfort, and Anne too little
for Mary&rsquo;s satisfaction. But money appears to have been the
first and real cause of ill-feeling. The granting away by William
of the private estate of James, amounting to 22,000 pounds a year, to
which Anne had some claim, was made a grievance, and a
factious motion brought forward in the House to increase her
civil list pension of 30,000 pounds, which she enjoyed in addition to
20,000 pounds under her marriage settlement, greatly displeased
William and Mary, who regarded it as a plot to make Anne
independent and the chief of a separate interest in the state,
while their resentment was increased by the refusal of Anne to
restrain the action of her friends, and by its success. The
Marlboroughs had been active in the affair and had benefited by
it, the countess (as she then was) receiving a pension of 1000 pounds,
and their conduct was noticed at court. The promised Garter
was withheld from Marlborough, and the incensed &ldquo;Mrs Morley&rdquo;
in her letters to &ldquo;Mrs Freeman&rdquo; styled the king &ldquo;Caliban&rdquo;
or the &ldquo;Dutch Monster.&rdquo; At the close of 1691 Anne had
declared her approval of the naval expedition in favour of her
father, and expressed grief at its failure.<a name="fa4c" id="fa4c" href="#ft4c"><span class="sp">4</span></a> According to the
doubtful <i>Life of James</i>, she wrote to him on the 1st of December
a &ldquo;most penitential and dutiful&rdquo; letter, and henceforward kept
up with him a &ldquo;fair correspondence.&rdquo;<a name="fa5c" id="fa5c" href="#ft5c"><span class="sp">5</span></a> The same year the
breach between the royal sisters was made final by the dismissal
of Marlborough, justly suspected of Jacobite intrigues, from all
his appointments. Anne took the part of her favourites with
great zeal against the court, though in all probability unaware
of Marlborough&rsquo;s treason; and on the dismissal of the countess
from her household by the king and queen she refused to part
with her, and retired with Lady Marlborough to the duke of
Somerset&rsquo;s residence at Sion House. Anne was now in disgrace.
She was deprived of her guard of honour, and Prince George, on
entering Kensington Palace, received no salute, though the
drums beat loudly on his departure.<a name="fa6c" id="fa6c" href="#ft6c"><span class="sp">6</span></a> Instructions were given
that the court expected no one to pay his respects, and no
attention in the provinces was to be shown to their rank. In
May, Marlborough was arrested on a charge of high treason which
subsequently broke down, and Anne persisted in regarding his
disgrace as a personal injury to herself. In August 1693, however,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page66" id="page66"></a>66</span>
the two sisters were temporarily reconciled, and on the occasion
of Mary&rsquo;s last illness and death Anne showed an affectionate
consideration.</p>

<p>The death of Mary weakened William&rsquo;s position and made
it necessary to cultivate good relations with the princess. She
was now treated with every honour and civility, and finally
established with her own court at St James&rsquo;s Palace. At the
same time William kept her in the background and refrained
from appointing her regent during his absence. In March 1695
Marlborough was allowed to kiss the king&rsquo;s hands, and subsequently
was made the duke of Gloucester&rsquo;s governor and restored
to his employments. In return Anne gave her support to
William&rsquo;s government, though about this time, in 1696&mdash;according
to James, in consequence of the near prospect of the throne&mdash;
she wrote to her father asking for his leave to wear the crown
at William&rsquo;s death, and promising its restoration at a convenient
opportunity.<a name="fa7c" id="fa7c" href="#ft7c"><span class="sp">7</span></a> The unfounded rumour that William contemplated
settling the succession after his death on James&rsquo;s son,
provided he were educated a Protestant in England, may possibly
have alarmed her.<a name="fa8c" id="fa8c" href="#ft8c"><span class="sp">8</span></a> Meanwhile, since the birth of the duke of
Gloucester, the princess had experienced six more miscarriages,
and had given birth to two children who only survived a few
hours, and the last maternal hope flickered out on the death of
the young prince on the 29th of July 1700. Henceforth Anne
signs herself in her letters to Lady Marlborough as &ldquo;your poor
unfortunate&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;faithful Morley.&rdquo; In default of her
own issue, Anne&rsquo;s personal choice would probably have inclined
at this time to her own family at St Germains, but the necessity
of maintaining the Protestant succession caused the enactment
of the Act of Settlement in 1701, and the substitution of the
Hanoverian branch. She wore mourning for her father in 1701,
and before his death James is said to have written to his daughter
asking for her protection for his family; but the recognition of his
son by Louis XIV. as king of England effectually prevented any
good offices to which her feelings might have inclined her.</p>

<p>On the 8th of March 1702 Anne became, by King William&rsquo;s
death, queen of Great Britain, being crowned on the 23rd of
April. Her reign was destined to be one of the most brilliant
in the annals of England. Splendid military triumphs crushed
the hereditary national foe. The Act of Union with Scotland
constituted one of the strongest foundations of the future
empire. Art and literature found a fresh renascence.</p>

<p>In her first speech to parliament, like George III. afterwards,
Anne declared her &ldquo;heart to be entirely English,&rdquo; words which
were resented by some as a reflection on the late king. A
ministry, mostly Tory, with Godolphin at its head, was established.
She obtained a grant of 700,000 pounds a year, and hastened to bestow
a pension of 100,000 pounds on her husband, whom she created generalissimo
of her forces and lord high admiral, while Marlborough
obtained the Garter, with the captain-generalship and other
prizes, including a dukedom, and the duchess was made mistress
of the robes with the control of the privy purse. The queen
showed from the first a strong interest in church matters, and
declared her intention to keep church appointments in her own
hands. She detested equally Roman Catholics and dissenters,
showed a strong leaning towards the high-church party, and gave
zealous support to the bill forbidding occasional conformity.
In 1704 she announced to the Commons her intention of granting
to the church the crown revenues, amounting to about 16,000 pounds or
17,000 pounds a year, from tenths and first-fruits (paid originally by
the clergy to the pope, but appropriated by the crown in 1534),
for the increase of poor livings; her gift, under the name of
&ldquo;Queen Anne&rsquo;s Bounty,&rdquo; still remaining as a testimony of her
piety. This devotion to the church, the strongest of all motives
in Anne&rsquo;s conduct, dictated her hesitating attitude towards
the two great parties in the state. The Tories had for this reason
her personal preference, while the Whigs, who included her powerful
favourites the Marlboroughs, identified their interests with
the war and its glorious successes, the queen slowly and unwillingly,
but inevitably, gravitating towards the latter.</p>

<p>In December, the archduke Charles visited Anne at Windsor
and was welcomed as the king of Spain. In 1704 Anne acquiesced
in the resignation of Lord Nottingham, the leader of the high
Tory party. In the same year the great victory of Blenheim
further consolidated the power of the Whigs and increased the
influence of Marlborough, upon whom Anne now conferred the
manor of Woodstock. Nevertheless, she declared in November
to the duchess that whenever things leaned towards the Whigs,
&ldquo;I shall think the church is beginning to be in danger.&rdquo; Next
year she supported the election of the Whig speaker, John Smith,
but long resisted the influence and claims of the <i>Junto</i>, as the
Whig leaders, Somers, Halifax, Orford, Wharton and Sunderland,
were named. In October she was obliged to appoint Cowper,
a Whig, lord chancellor, with all the ecclesiastical patronage
belonging to the office. Marlborough&rsquo;s successive victories,
and especially the factious conduct of the Tories, who in
November 1705 moved in parliament that the electress Sophia
should be invited to England, drove Anne farther to the side
of the Whigs. But she opposed for some time the inclusion in
the government of Sunderland, whom she especially disliked, only
consenting at Marlborough&rsquo;s intercession in December 1706,
when various other offices and rewards were bestowed upon
Whigs, and Nottingham with other Tories was removed from the
council. She yielded, after a struggle, also to the appointment
of Whigs to bishoprics, the most mortifying submission of all.
In 1708 she was forced to dismiss Harley, who, with the aid of
Mrs Masham, had been intriguing against the government and
projecting the creation of a third party. Abigail Hill, Mrs
Masham, a cousin of the duchess of Marlborough, had been
introduced by the latter as a poor relation into Anne&rsquo;s service,
while still princess of Denmark. The queen found relief in the
quiet and respectful demeanour of her attendant, and gradually
came to prefer her society to that of the termagant and tempestuous
duchess. Abigail, however, soon ventured to talk
&ldquo;business,&rdquo; and in the summer of 1707 the duchess discovered
to her indignation that her protégée had already undermined
her influence with the queen and had become the medium of
Harley&rsquo;s intrigue. The strength of the Whigs at this time and
the necessities of the war caused the retirement of Harley,
but he remained Anne&rsquo;s secret adviser and supporter against
the faction, urging upon her &ldquo;the dangers to the crown as well
as to the church and monarchy itself from their counsels and
actions,&rdquo;<a name="fa9c" id="fa9c" href="#ft9c"><span class="sp">9</span></a> while the duchess never regained her former influence.
The inclusion in the cabinet of Somers, whom she especially
disliked as the hostile critic of Prince George&rsquo;s admiralty
administration, was the subject of another prolonged struggle,
ending again in the queen&rsquo;s submission after a futile appeal
to Marlborough in October 1708, to which she brought herself
only to avoid a motion from the Whigs for the removal of the
prince, then actually on his deathbed. His death on the 28th of
October was felt deeply by the queen, and opened the way for
the inclusion of more Whigs. But no reconciliation with the
duchess took place, and in 1709 a further dispute led to an angry
correspondence, the queen finally informing the duchess of the
termination of their friendship, and the latter drawing up a
long narrative of her services, which she forwarded to Anne
together with suitable passages on the subject of friendship
and charity transcribed from the Prayer Book, the <i>Whole Duty
of Man</i> and from Jeremy Taylor.<a name="fa10c" id="fa10c" href="#ft10c"><span class="sp">10</span></a> Next year Anne&rsquo;s desire
to give a regiment to Hill, Mrs Masham&rsquo;s brother, led to another
ineffectual attempt in retaliation to displace the new favourite,
and the queen showed her antagonism to the Whig administration
on the occasion of the prosecution of Sacheverell. She was
present at his trial and was publicly acclaimed by the mob as
his supporter, while the Tory divine was consoled immediately
on the expiration of his sentence with the living of St Andrew&rsquo;s,
Holborn. Subsequently the duchess, in a final interview which
she had forced upon the queen, found her tears and reproaches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>67</span>
unavailing. In her anger she had told the queen she wished for
no answer, and she was now met by a stony and exasperating
silence, broken only by the words constantly repeated, &ldquo;You
desired no answer and you shall have none.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The fall of the Whigs, now no longer necessary on account of
the successful issue of the war, to accomplish which Harley had
long been preparing and intriguing, followed; and their attempt
to prolong hostilities from party motives failed. A friend of
Harley, the duke of Shrewsbury, was first appointed to office,
and subsequently the great body of the Whigs were displaced
by Tories, Harley being made chancellor of the exchequer and
Henry St John secretary of state. The queen was rejoiced
at being freed from what she called a long captivity, and the
new parliament was returned with a Tory majority. On the
17th of January 1711, in spite of Marlborough&rsquo;s efforts to ward
off the blow, the duchess was compelled to give up her key of
office. The queen was now able once more to indulge in her
favourite patronage of the church, and by her influence an act
was passed in 1712 for building fifty new churches in London.
Later, in 1714, she approved of the Schism Bill. She gave strong
support to Harley, now earl of Oxford and lord treasurer, in
the intrigues and negotiations for peace. Owing to the alliance
between the Tory Lord Nottingham and the Whigs, on the
condition of the support by the latter of the bill against occasional
conformity passed in December 1711, the defeated Whigs
maintained a majority in the Lords, who declared against any
peace which left Spain to the Bourbons. To break down this
opposition Marlborough was dismissed on the 31st from all his
employments, while the House of Lords was &ldquo;swamped&rdquo; by
Anne&rsquo;s creation of twelve peers,<a name="fa11c" id="fa11c" href="#ft11c"><span class="sp">11</span></a> including Mrs Masham&rsquo;s
husband. The queen&rsquo;s conduct was generally approved, for the
nation was now violently adverse to the Whigs and war party;
and the peace of Utrecht was finally signed on the 31st of March
1713, and proclaimed on the 5th of May in London.</p>

<p>As the queen&rsquo;s reign drew to its close, rumours were rife on the
great subject of the succession to the throne. Various Jacobite
appointments excited suspicion. Both Oxford and Bolingbroke
were in communication with the Pretender&rsquo;s party, and on the
27th of July Oxford, who had gradually lost influence and
quarrelled with Bolingbroke, resigned, leaving the supreme
power in the hands of the latter. Anne herself had a natural
feeling for her brother, and had shown great solicitude concerning
his treatment when a price had been set on his head at the
time of the Scottish expedition in 1708. On the 3rd of March
1714 James wrote to Anne, Oxford and Bolingbroke, urging the
necessity of taking steps to secure his succession, and promising,
on the condition of his recognition, to make no further attempts
against the queen&rsquo;s government; and in April a report was
circulated in Holland that Anne had secretly determined to
associate James with her in the government. The wish expressed
by the Whigs, that a member of the electoral family should be
invited to England, had already aroused the queen&rsquo;s indignation
in 1708; and now, in 1714, a writ of summons for the electoral
prince as duke of Cambridge having been obtained, Anne forbade
the Hanoverian envoy, Baron Schütz, her presence, and declared
all who supported the project her enemies; while to a memorial
on the same subject from the electress Sophia and her grandson
in May, Anne replied in an angry letter, which is said to have
caused the death of the electress on the 5th of June, requesting
them not to trouble the peace of her realm or diminish her
authority.</p>

<p>These demonstrations, however, were the outcome not of any
returning partiality for her own family, but of her intense dislike,
in which she resembled Queen Elizabeth, of any &ldquo;successor,&rdquo;
&ldquo;it being a thing I cannot bear to have any successor here
though but for a week&rdquo;; and in spite of some appearances to
the contrary, it is certain that religion and political wisdom
kept Anne firm to the Protestant succession.<a name="fa12c" id="fa12c" href="#ft12c"><span class="sp">12</span></a> She had maintained
a friendly correspondence with the court of Hanover since
1705, and in 1706 had bestowed the Garter on the electoral
prince and created him duke of Cambridge; while the Regency
Act provided for the declaration of the legal heir to the crown
by the council immediately on the queen&rsquo;s death, and a further
enactment naturalized the electress and her issue. In 1708, on
the occasion of the Scottish expedition, notwithstanding her
solicitude for his safety, she had styled James in her speech
closing the session of parliament as &ldquo;a popish pretender bred
up in the principles of the most arbitrary government.&rdquo; The
duchess of Marlborough stated in 1713 that all the time she had
known &ldquo;that thing&rdquo; (as she now called the queen), &ldquo;she had never
heard her speak a favourable word of him.&rdquo;<a name="fa13c" id="fa13c" href="#ft13c"><span class="sp">13</span></a> No answer appears
to have been sent to James&rsquo;s letter in 1714; on the contrary, a
proclamation was issued (June 23) for his apprehension in case
of his arrival in England. On the 27th of April Anne gave a
solemn assurance of her fidelity to the Hanoverian succession
to Sir William Dawes, archbishop of York; in June she sent
Lord Clarendon to Hanover to satisfy the elector.</p>

<p>The sudden illness and death of the queen now frustrated any
schemes which Bolingbroke, or others might have been contemplating.
On the 27th, the day of Oxford&rsquo;s resignation, the
discussions concerning his successor detained the council sitting
in the queen&rsquo;s presence till two o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and on
retiring Anne was instantly seized with fatal illness. Her adherence
to William in 1688 had been a principal cause of the
success of the Revolution, and now the final act of her life was
to secure the Revolution settlement and the Protestant succession.
During a last moment of returning consciousness, and by
the advice of the whole council, who had been joined on their
own initiative by the Whig dukes Argyll and Somerset, she placed
the lord treasurer&rsquo;s staff in the hands of the Whig duke of
Shrewsbury, and measures were immediately taken for assuring
the succession of the elector. Her death took place on the 1st
of August, and the security felt by the public, and perhaps the
sense of perils escaped by the termination of the queen&rsquo;s life,
were shown by a considerable rise in the national stocks. She
was buried on the south side of Henry VII.&rsquo;s chapel in Westminster
Abbey, in the same tomb as her husband and children.
The elector of Hanover, George Louis, son of the electress
Sophia (daughter of Elizabeth, daughter of James I.), peacefully
succeeded to the throne as George I. (<i>q.v.</i>).</p>

<p>According to her physician Arbuthnot, Anne&rsquo;s life was
shortened by the &ldquo;scene of contention among her servants. I
believe sleep was never more welcome to a weary traveller than
death was to her.&rdquo; By character and temperament unfitted to
stand alone, her life had been unhappy and tragical from its
isolation. Separated in early years from her parents and sister,
her one great friendship had proved only baneful and ensnaring.
Marriage had only brought a mournful series of infant funerals.
Constant ill-health and suffering had darkened her career. The
claims of family attachment, of religion, of duty, of patriotism
and of interest, had dragged her in opposite directions, and her
whole life had been a prey to jealousies and factions which closed
around her at her accession to the throne, and surged to their
height when she lay on her deathbed. The modern theory of the
relations between the sovereign and the parties, by which the
former identifies himself with the faction for the time in power
while maintaining his detachment from all, had not then been
invented; and Anne, like her Hanoverian successors, maintained
the struggle, though without success, to rule independently
finding support in Harley. During the first year of her reign
she made known that she was &ldquo;resolved not to follow the
example of her predecessor in making use of a few of her subjects
to oppress the rest. She will be queen of all her subjects, and
would have all the parties and distinctions of former reigns ended
and buried in hers.&rdquo;<a name="fa14c" id="fa14c" href="#ft14c"><span class="sp">14</span></a> Her motive for getting rid of the Whigs
was not any real dislike of their administration, but the wish to
escape from the domination of the party,<a name="fa15c" id="fa15c" href="#ft15c"><span class="sp">15</span></a> and on the advent
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page68" id="page68"></a>68</span>
to power of the Tories she carefully left some Whigs in their
employments, with the aim of breaking up the party system and
acting upon what was called &ldquo;a moderate scheme.&rdquo; She
attended debates in the Lords and endeavoured to influence
votes. Her struggles to free herself from the influence of factions
only involved her deeper; she was always under the domination
of some person or some party, and she could not rise above them
and show herself the leader of the nation like Elizabeth.</p>

<p>Anne was a women of small ability, of dull mind, and of that
kind of obstinacy which accompanies weakness of character.
According to the duchess she had &ldquo;a certain knack of sticking
to what had been dictated to her to a degree often very disagreeable,
and without the least sign of understanding or judgment.&rdquo;<a name="fa16c" id="fa16c" href="#ft16c"><span class="sp">16</span></a>
&ldquo;I desire you would not have so ill an opinion of me,&rdquo;
Anne writes to Oxford, &ldquo;as to think when I have determined
anything in my mind I will alter it.&rdquo;<a name="fa17c" id="fa17c" href="#ft17c"><span class="sp">17</span></a> Burnet considered that
&ldquo;she laid down the splendour of a court too much,&rdquo; which was
&ldquo;as it were abandoned.&rdquo; She dined alone after her husband&rsquo;s
death, but it was reported by no means abstemiously, the royal
family being characterized in the lines:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">
<p>&ldquo;King William thinks all.</p>
<p class="i05">Queen Mary talks all,</p>
<p class="i05">Prince George drinks all,</p>
<p class="i05">And Princess Anne eats all.&rdquo;<a name="fa18c" id="fa18c" href="#ft18c"><span class="sp">18</span></a></p>
</div> </td></tr></table>

<p class="noind">She took no interest in the art, the drama or the literature of
her day. But she possessed the homely virtues; she was deeply
religious, attached to the Church of England and concerned for
the efficiency of the ministry. One of the first acts of her reign
was a proclamation against vice, and Lord Chesterfield regretted
the strict morality of her court. Instances abound of her kindness
and consideration for others. Her moderation towards
the Jacobites in Scotland, after the Pretender&rsquo;s expedition in
1708, was much praised by Saint Simon. She showed great
forbearance and generosity towards the duchess of Marlborough
in the face of unexampled provocation, and her character was
unduly disparaged by the latter, who with her violent and coarse
nature could not understand the queen&rsquo;s self-restraint in sorrow,
and describes her as &ldquo;very hard&rdquo; and as &ldquo;not apt to cry.&rdquo;
According to her small ability she served the state well, and was
zealous and conscientious in the fulfilment of public duties, in
which may be included touching for the king&rsquo;s evil, which she
revived. Marlborough testifies to her energy in finding money
for the war. She surrendered 10,000 pounds a year for public purposes,
and in 1706 she presented 30,000 pounds to the officers and soldiers
who had lost their horses. Her contemporaries almost unanimously
record her excellence and womanly virtues; and by
Dean Swift, no mild critic, she is invariably spoken of with
respect, and named in his will as of &ldquo;ever glorious, immortal
and truly pious memory, the real nursing-mother of her kingdoms.&rdquo;
She deserves her appellation of &ldquo;Good Queen Anne,&rdquo;
and notwithstanding her failings must be included among the
chief authors and upholders of the great Revolution settlement.
Her person was described by Spanheim, the Prussian ambassador,
as handsome though inclining to stoutness, with black hair, blue
eyes and good features, and of grave aspect.</p>

<p>Anne&rsquo;s husband, Prince George (1653-1708), was the second
son of Frederick III., king of Denmark. Before marrying Anne
he had been a candidate for the throne of Poland. He was
created earl of Kendal and duke of Cumberland in 1689.
Some censure, which was directed against the prince in his
capacity as lord high admiral, was terminated by his death.
In religion George remained a Lutheran, and in general his
qualities tended to make him a good husband rather than a
soldier or a statesman.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANNE<a name="ar26" id="ar26"></a></span> (1693-1740), empress of Russia, second daughter of Tsar
Ivan V., Peter the Great&rsquo;s imbecile brother, and Praskovia
Saltuikova. Her girlhood was passed at Ismailovo near Moscow,
with her mother, an ignorant, bigoted tsaritsa of the old school,
who neglected and even hated her daughters. Peter acted as a
second father to the Ivanovs, as Praskovia and her family were
called. In 1710 he married Anne to Frederick William, duke of
Courland, who died of surfeit on his journey home from St
Petersburg. The reluctant young widow was ordered to proceed
on her way to Mittau to take over the government of Courland,
with the Russian resident, Count Peter Bestuzhev, as her adviser.
He was subsequently her lover, till supplanted by Biren (<i>q.v.</i>).
Anne&rsquo;s residence at Mittau was embittered by the utter inadequacy
of her revenue, which she keenly felt. It was therefore with joy
that she at once accepted the Russian crown, as the next heir,
after the death of Peter II. (January 30, 1730), when it was offered
to her by the members of the supreme privy council, even going
so far as to subscribe previously nine articles which would have
reduced her from an absolute to a very limited monarch. On
the 26th of February she made her public entry into Moscow under
strict surveillance. On the 8th of March a <i>coup d&rsquo;état</i>, engineered
by a party of her personal friends, overthrew the supreme privy
council and she was hailed as autocrat. Her government, on the
whole, was prudent, beneficial and even glorious; but it was
undoubtedly severe and became at last universally unpopular.
This was due in the main to the outrageous insolence of her all-powerful
favourite Biren, who hated the Russian nobility and
trampled upon them mercilessly. Fortunately, Biren was
sufficiently prudent not to meddle with foreign affairs or with the
army, and these departments in the able hands of two other
foreigners, who thoroughly identified themselves with Russia,
Andrei Osterman (<i>q.v.</i>) and Burkhardt Münnich (<i>q.v.</i>) did great
things in the reign of Anne. The chief political events of the
period were the War of the Polish Succession and the second<a name="fa1d" id="fa1d" href="#ft1d"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
Crimean War. The former was caused by the reappearance of
Stanislaus Leszczynski as a candidate for the Polish throne after
the death of Augustus II. (February 1, 1733). The interests of
Russia would not permit her to recognize a candidate dependent
directly on France and indirectly upon Sweden and Turkey, all
three powers being at that time opposed to Russia&rsquo;s &ldquo;system.&rdquo;
She accordingly united with Austria to support the candidature of
the late king&rsquo;s son, Augustus of Saxony. So far as Russia was concerned,
the War of the Polish Succession was quickly over. Much
more important was the Crimean War of 1736-39. This war marks
the beginning of that systematic struggle on the part of Russia to
recover her natural and legitimate southern boundaries. It lasted
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page69" id="page69"></a>69</span>
four years and a half, and cost her a hundred thousand men and
millions of roubles; and though invariably successful, she had to
be content with the acquisition of a single city (Azov) with a small
district at the mouth of the Don. Yet more had been gained than
was immediately apparent. In the first place, this was the only
war hitherto waged by Russia against Turkey which had not ended
in crushing disaster. Münnich had at least dissipated the illusion
of Ottoman invincibility, and taught the Russian soldier that
100,000 janissaries and spahis were no match, in a fair field, for
half that number of grenadiers and hussars. In the second place
the Tatar hordes had been well nigh exterminated. In the third
place Russia&rsquo;s signal and unexpected successes in the Steppe had
immensely increased her prestige on the continent. &ldquo;This court
begins to have a great deal to say in the affairs of Europe,&rdquo;
remarked the English minister, Sir Claudius Rondeau, a year later.</p>

<p>The last days of Anne were absorbed by the endeavour to
strengthen the position of the heir to the throne, the baby
cesarevich Ivan, afterwards Ivan VI., the son of the empress&rsquo;s
niece, Anna Leopoldovna, against the superior claims of her
cousin the cesarevna Elizabeth. The empress herself died three
months later (28th of October 1740). Her last act was to
appoint Biren regent during the infancy of her great-nephew.</p>

<p>Anne was a grim, sullen woman, frankly sensual, but as well-meaning
as ignorance and vindictiveness would allow her to be.
But she had much natural good sense, was a true friend and, in
her more cheerful moments, an amiable companion. Lady
Rondeau&rsquo;s portrait of the empress shows her to the best advantage.
She is described as a large woman, towering above all the
cavaliers of her court, but very well shaped for her size, easy and
graceful in her person, of a majestic bearing, but with an awfulness
in her countenance which revolted those who disliked her.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANNE OF BRITTANY<a name="ar27" id="ar27"></a></span> (1477-1514), daughter of Francis II.,
duke of Brittany, and Marguerite de Foix. She was scarcely
twelve years old when she succeeded her father as duchess on
the 9th of September 1488. Charles VIII. aimed at establishing
his authority over her; Alain d&rsquo;Albret wished to marry her;
Jean de Rohan claimed the duchy; and her guardian, the marshal
de Rieux, was soon in open revolt against his sovereign. In 1489
the French army invaded Brittany. In order to protect her
independence, Anne concluded an alliance with Maximilian of
Austria, and soon married him by proxy (December 1489). But
Maximilian was incapable of defending her, and in 1491 the young
duchess found herself compelled to treat with Charles VIII. and
to marry him. The two sovereigns made a reciprocal arrangement
as to their rights and pretensions to the crown of Brittany, but
in the event of Charles predeceasing her, Anne undertook to marry
the heir to the throne. Nevertheless, in 1492, after the conspiracy
of Jean de Rohan, who had endeavoured to hand over the duchy
to the king of England, Charles VIII. confirmed the privileges of
Brittany, and in particular guaranteed to the Bretons the right of
paying only those taxes to which the assembly of estates consented,
After the death of Charles VIII. in 1498, without any children,
Anne exercised the sovereignty in Brittany, and in January 1499
she married Louis XII., who had just repudiated Joan of France.
The marriage contract was ostensibly directed in favour of the
independence of Brittany, for it declared that Brittany should
revert to the second son or to the eldest daughter of the two
sovereigns, and, failing issue, to the natural heirs of the duchess.
Until her death Anne occupied herself personally with the
administration of the duchy. In 1504 she caused the treaty of
Blois to be concluded, which assured the hand of her daughter,
Claude of France, to Charles of Austria (the future emperor,
Charles V.), and promised him the possession of Brittany, Burgundy
and the county of Blois. But this unpopular treaty was broken,
and the queen had to consent to the betrothal of Claude to Francis
of Angoulême, who in 1515 became king of France as Francis I.
Thus the definitive reunion of Brittany and France was prepared.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANNE OF CLEVES<a name="ar28" id="ar28"></a></span> (1515-1557), fourth wife of Henry VIII.,
king of England, daughter of John, duke of Cleves, and Mary,
only daughter of William, duke of Juliers, was born on the 22nd
of September 1515. Her father was the leader of the German
Protestants, and the princess, after the death of Jane Seymour,
was regarded by Cromwell as a suitable wife for Henry VIII.
She had been brought up in a narrow retirement, could speak no
language but her own, had no looks, no accomplishments and no
dowry, her only recommendations being her proficiency in
needlework, and her meek and gentle temper. Nevertheless her
picture, painted by Holbein by the king&rsquo;s command (now in the
Louvre, a modern copy at Windsor), pleased Henry and the
marriage was arranged, the treaty being signed on the 24th of
September 1539. The princess landed at Deal on the 27th of
December; Henry met her at Rochester on the 1st of January
1540, and was so much abashed at her appearance as to forget
to present the gift he had brought for her, but nevertheless
controlled himself sufficiently to treat her with courtesy. The
next day he expressed openly his dissatisfaction at her looks;
&ldquo;she was no better than a Flanders mare.&rdquo; The attempt to
prove a pre-contract with the son of the duke of Lorraine broke
down, and Henry was forced to resign himself to the sacrifice.
On the wedding morning, however, the 6th of January 1540, he
declared that no earthly thing would have induced him to marry
her but the fear of driving the duke of Cleves into the arms of
the emperor. Shortly afterwards Henry had reason to regret
the policy which had identified him so closely with the German
Protestantism, and denied reconciliation with the emperor.
Cromwell&rsquo;s fall was the result, and the chief obstacle to the
repudiation of his wife being thus removed, Henry declared the
marriage had not been and could not be consummated; and did
not scruple to cast doubts on his wife&rsquo;s honour. On the 9th of
July the marriage was declared null and void by convocation,
and an act of parliament to the same effect was passed immediately.
Henry soon afterwards married Catherine Howard. On
first hearing of the king&rsquo;s intentions, Anne swooned away, but on
recovering, while declaring her case a very hard and sorrowful
one from the great love which she bore to the king, acquiesced
quietly in the arrangements made for her by Henry, by which
she received lands to the value of £4000 a year, renounced the
title of queen for that of the king&rsquo;s sister, and undertook not to
leave the kingdom. In a letter to her brother, drawn up by
Gardiner by the king&rsquo;s direction, she acknowledged the unreality
of the marriage and the king&rsquo;s kindness and generosity. Anne
spent the rest of her life happily in England at Richmond or
Bletchingley, occasionally visiting the court, and being described
as joyous as ever, and wearing new dresses every day! An
attempt to procure her reinstalment on the disgrace of Catherine
Howard failed, and there was no foundation for the report that
she had given birth to a child of which Henry was the reputed
father. She was present at the marriage of Henry with Catherine
Parr and at the coronation of Mary. She died on the 28th of
July 1557 at Chelsea, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANNE OF DENMARK<a name="ar29" id="ar29"></a></span> (1574-1619), queen of James I. of
England and VI. of Scotland, daughter of King Frederick II. of
Denmark and Norway and of Sophia, daughter of Ulric III., duke
of Mecklenburg, was born on the 12th of December 1574. On the
20th of August 1589, in spite of Queen Elizabeth&rsquo;s opposition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page70" id="page70"></a>70</span>
she was married by proxy to King James, without dower, the
alliance, however, settling definitely the Scottish claims to
the Orkney and Shetland Islands. Her voyage to Scotland was
interrupted by a violent storm&mdash;for the raising of which several
Danish and Scottish witches were burned or executed&mdash;which
drove her on the coast of Norway, whither the impatient James
came to meet her, the marriage taking place at Opslo (now
Christiania) on the 23rd of November. The royal couple, after
visiting Denmark, arrived in Scotland in May 1590. The position
of queen consort to a Scottish king was a difficult and perilous
one, and Anne was attacked in connexion with various scandals
and deeds of violence, her share in which, however, is supported
by no evidence. The birth of an heir to the throne (Prince
Henry) in 1504 strengthened her position and influence; but
the young prince, much to her indignation, was immediately
withdrawn from her care and entrusted to the keeping of the
earl and countess of Mar at Stirling Castle; in 1595 James gave
a written command, forbidding them in case of his death to give
up the prince to the queen till he reached the age of eighteen.
The king&rsquo;s intention was, no doubt, to secure himself and the
prince against the unruly nobles, though the queen&rsquo;s Roman
Catholic tendencies were probably another reason for his decision.
Brought up a Lutheran, and fond of pleasure, she had shown
no liking for Scottish Calvinism, and soon incurred rebukes on
account of her religion, &ldquo;vanity,&rdquo; absence from church, &ldquo;night
waking and balling.&rdquo; She had become secretly inclined to
Roman Catholicism, and attended mass with the king&rsquo;s connivance.
On the death of Queen Elizabeth, on the 24th of March
1603, James preceded her to London. Anne took advantage
of his absence to demand possession of the prince, and, on the
&ldquo;flat refusal&rdquo; of the countess of Mar, fell into a passion, the
violence of which occasioned a miscarriage and endangered her
life. In June she followed the king to England (after distributing
all her effects in Edinburgh among her ladies) with the prince
and the coffin containing the body of her dead infant, and
reached Windsor on the 2nd of July, where amidst other forms
of good fortune she entered into the possession of Queen
Elizabeth&rsquo;s 6000 dresses.</p>

<p>On the 24th of July Anne was crowned with the king, when her
refusal to take the sacrament according to the Anglican use
created some sensation. She communicated on one occasion
subsequently and attended Anglican service occasionally; but
she received consecrated objects from Pope Clement VIII.,
continued to hear mass, and, according to Galluzzi, supported
the schemes for the conversion of the prince of Wales and of
England, and for the prince&rsquo;s marriage with a Roman Catholic
princess, which collapsed on his death in 1612. She was claimed
as a convert by the Jesuits.<a name="fa1e" id="fa1e" href="#ft1e"><span class="sp">1</span></a> Nevertheless on her deathbed,
when she was attended by the archbishop of Canterbury and the
bishop of London, she used expressions which were construed
as a declaration of Protestantism. Notwithstanding religious
differences she lived in great harmony and affection with the
king, latterly, however, residing mostly apart. She helped to
raise Buckingham to power in the place of Somerset, maintained
friendly relations with him, and approved of his guidance and
control of the king. In spite of her birth and family she was at
first favourably inclined to Spain, disapproved of her daughter
Elizabeth&rsquo;s marriage with the elector palatine, and supported
the Spanish marriages for her sons, but subsequently veered
round towards France. She used all her influence in favour of
the unfortunate Raleigh, answering his petition to her for
protection with a personal letter of appeal to Buckingham to save
his life. &ldquo;She carrieth no sway in state matters,&rdquo; however, it
was said of her in 1605, &ldquo;and, <i>praeter rem uxoriam</i>, hath no great
reach in other affairs.&rdquo; &ldquo;She does not mix herself up in affairs,
though the king tells her anything she chooses to ask, and loves
and esteems her.&rdquo;<a name="fa2e" id="fa2e" href="#ft2e"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Her interest in state matters was only
occasional, and secondary to the pre-occupations of court
festivities, masks, progresses, dresses, jewels, which she much
enjoyed; the court being, says Wilson&mdash;whose severity cannot
entirely suppress his admiration&mdash;&ldquo;a continued maskarado,
where she and her ladies, like so many nymphs or Nereides,
appeared ... to the ravishment of the beholders,&rdquo; and &ldquo;made
the night more glorious than the day.&rdquo; Occasionally she even
joined in the king&rsquo;s sports, though here her only recorded exploit
was her accidental shooting of James&rsquo;s &ldquo;most principal and
special hound,&rdquo; Jewel. Her extravagant expenditure, returned
by Salisbury in 1605 at more than £50,000 and by Chamberlain
at her death at more than £84,000, was unfavourably contrasted
with the economy of Queen Elizabeth; in spite of large allowances
and grants of estates which included Oatlands, Greenwich House
and Nonsuch, it greatly exceeded her income, her debts in 1616
being reckoned at nearly £10,000, while her jewelry and her
plate were valued at her death at nearly half a million. Anne
died after a long illness on the 2nd of March 1619, and was buried
in Westminster Abbey. She was generally regretted. The
severe Wilson, while rebuking her gaieties, allows that she was
&ldquo;a good woman,&rdquo; and that her character would stand the most
prying investigation. She was intelligent and tactful, a faithful
wife, a devoted mother and a staunch friend. Besides several
children who died in infancy she had Henry, prince of Wales,
who died in 1612, Charles, afterwards King Charles I., and
Elizabeth, electress palatine and queen of Bohemia.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANNE OF FRANCE<a name="ar30" id="ar30"></a></span> (1460-1522), dame de Beaujeu, was the
eldest daughter of Louis XI. and Charlotte of Savoy. Louis XI.
betrothed her at first to Nicholas of Anjou, and afterwards
offered her hand successively to Charles the Bold, to the duke
of Brittany, and even to his own brother, Charles of France.
Finally she married Pierre de Beaujeu, a younger brother of
the duke of Bourbon. Before his death Louis XI. entrusted
to Pierre de Beaujeu and Anne the entire charge of his son,
Charles VIII., a lad of thirteen; and from 1483 to 1492 the
Beaujeus exercised a virtual regency. Anne was a true daughter
of Louis XI. Energetic, obstinate, cunning and unscrupulous,
she inherited, too, her father&rsquo;s avarice and rapacity. Although
they made some concessions, the Beaujeus succeeded in maintaining
the results of the previous reign, and in triumphing over
the feudal intrigues and coalitions, as was seen from the meeting
of the estates general in 1484, and the results of the &ldquo;Mad
War&rdquo; (1485) and the war with Brittany (1488); and in spite
of the efforts of Maximilian of Austria they concluded the marriage
of Charles VIII. and Anne, duchess of Brittany (1491). But a
short time afterwards the king disengaged himself completely
from their tutelage, to the great detriment of the kingdom.
In 1488 Pierre de Beaujeu had succeeded to the Bourbonnais,
the last great fief of France. He died in 1503, but Anne survived
him twenty years. From her establishments at Moulins and
Chantelle in the Bourbonnais she continued henceforth vigorously
to defend the Bourbon cause against the royal family. Anne&rsquo;s
only daughter, Suzanne, had married in 1505 her cousin, Charles
of Bourbon, count of Montpensier, the future constable; and
the question of the succession of Suzanne, who died in 1521,
was the determining factor of the treason of the constable
de Bourbon (1523). Anne had died some months before, on
the 14th of November 1522.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANNEALING, HARDENING AND TEMPERING.<a name="ar31" id="ar31"></a></span> Annealing
(from the prefix <i>an</i>, and the old English <i>aélan</i>, to burn or bake;
the meaning has probably also been modified from the French
<i>nieler</i>, to enamel black on gold or silver, from the med. Lat.
<i>nigellare</i>, to make black; cf. <i>niello</i>) is a process of treating a
metal or alloy by heat with the object of imparting to it a certain
condition of ductility, extensibility, or a certain grade of softness
or hardness, with all that is involved in and follows from those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page71" id="page71"></a>71</span>
conditions. The effect may be mechanical only, or a chemical
change may take place also. Sometimes the causes are obvious,
in other cases they are more or less obscure. But of the actual
facts, and the immense importance of this operation as well as
of the related ones of tempering and hardening in shop processes,
there is no question.</p>

<p>When the treatment is of a mechanical character only, there
can be no reasonable doubt that the common belief is correct,
namely, that the metallic crystals or fibres undergo a molecular
rearrangement of some kind. When it is of a chemical character,
the process is one of cementation, due to the occlusion of gases
in the molecules of the metals.</p>

<p>Numerous examples of annealing due to molecular rearrangement
might be selected from the extensive range of workshop
operations. The following are a few only:&mdash;when a boiler-maker
bends the edges of a plate of steel or iron by hammer blows
(flanging), he does so in successive stages (heats), at each
of which the plate has to be reheated, with inevitable cooling
down during the time work is being done upon it. The result
is that the plate becomes brittle over the parts which have
been subjected to this treatment; and this brittleness is not
uniformly distributed, but is localized, and is a source of weakness,
inducing a liability to crack. If, however, the plate when
finished is raised to a full red heat, and allowed to cool down
away from access of cool air, as in a furnace, or underneath wood
ashes, it resumes its old ductility. The plate has been annealed,
and is as safe as it was before it was flanged. Again, when a
sheet of thin metal is forced to assume a shape very widely
different from its original plane aspect, as by hammering, or by
drawing out in a press&mdash;a cartridge case being a familiar example&mdash;it
is necessary to anneal it several times during the
progress of the operation. Without such annealing it would
never arrive at the final stage desired, but would become torn
asunder by the extension of its metallic fibres. Cutting tools
are made of steel having sufficient carbon to afford capacity
for hardening. Before the process is performed, the condition
in which the carbon is present renders the steel so hard and tough
as to render the preliminary turning or shaping necessary in
many cases (<i>e.g.</i> in milling cutters) a tedious operation. To lessen
this labour, the steel is first annealed. In this case it is brought
to a low red heat, and allowed to cool away from the air. It
can then be machined with comparative ease and be subsequently
hardened or tempered. When a metallic structure has endured
long service a state of fatigue results. Annealing is, where
practicable, resorted to in order to restore the original strength.
A familiar illustration is that of chains which are specially liable
to succumb to constant overstrain if continued for only a year
or two. This is so well known that the practice is regularly
adopted of annealing the chains at regular intervals. They
are put into a clear hot furnace and raised to a low red heat,
continued for a few hours, and then allowed to cool down in the
furnace after the withdrawal of the source of heat. Before the
annealing the fracture of a link would be more crystalline than
afterwards.</p>

<p>In these examples, and others of which these are typical,
two conditions are essential, one being the grade of temperature,
the other the cooling. The temperature must never be so high
as to cause the metal to become overheated, with risk of burning,
nor so low as to prevent the penetration of the substance with
a good volume of heat. It must also be continued for sufficient
time. More than this cannot be said. Each particular piece
of work requires its own treatment and period, and nothing
but experience of similar work will help the craftsman. The
cooling must always be gradual, such as that which results
from removing the source of heat, as by drawing a furnace fire,
or covering with non-conducting substances.</p>

<p>The chemical kind of annealing is specifically that employed
in the manufacture of malleable cast iron. In this process,
castings are made of white iron,&mdash;a brittle quality which has
its carbon wholly in the combined state. These castings, when
subjected to heat for a period of ten days or a fortnight, in closed
boxes, in the presence of substances containing oxygen, become
highly ductile. This change is due to the absorption of the carbon
by the oxygen in the cementing material, a comparatively pure
soft iron being left behind. The result is that the originally
hard, brittle castings after this treatment may be cut with a
knife, and be bent double and twisted into spirals without
fracturing.</p>

<p>The distinction between <i>hardening</i> and <i>tempering</i> is one of
degree only, and both are of an opposite character to annealing.
Hardening, in the shop sense, signifies the making of a piece
of steel about as hard as it can be made&mdash;&ldquo;glass hard&rdquo;&mdash;while
tempering indicates some stage in an infinite range between
the fully hardened and the annealed or softened condition.
As a matter of convenience only, hardening is usually a stage
in the work of tempering. It is easier to harden first, and &ldquo;let
down&rdquo; to the temper required, than to secure the exact heat
for tempering by raising the material to it. This is partly due
to the long established practice of estimating temperature by
colour tints; but this is being rapidly invaded by new methods
in which the temper heat is obtained in furnaces provided with
pyrometers, by means of which exact heat regulation is readily
secured, and in which the heating up is done gradually. Such
furnaces are used for hardening balls for bearings, cams, small
toothed wheels and similar work, as well as for tempering
springs, milling cutters and other kinds of cutting tools. But
for the cutting tools having single edges, as used in engineers&rsquo;
shops, the colour test is still generally retained.</p>

<p>In the practice of hardening and tempering tools by colour,
experience is the only safe guide. Colour tints vary with degrees
of light; steels of different brands require different treatment
in regard to temperature and quenching; and steels even of
identical chemical composition do not always behave alike when
tempered. Every fresh brand of steel has, therefore, to be
treated at first in a tentative and experimental fashion in order
to secure the best possible results. The larger the masses of
steel, and the greater the disparity in dimensions of adjacent
parts, the greater is the risk of cracking and distortion. Excessive
length and the presence of keen angles increase the
difficulties of hardening. The following points have to be
observed in the work of hardening and tempering.</p>

<p>A grade of steel must be selected of suitable quality for the
purpose for which it has to be used. There are a number of such
grades, ranging from about 1½ to ½% content of carbon, and
each having its special utility. Overheating must be avoided,
as that burns the steel and injures or ruins it. A safe rule is never
to heat any grade of steel to a temperature higher than that at
which experience proves it will take the temper required. Heating
must be regular and thorough throughout, and must therefore
be slowly done when dealing with thick masses. Contact with
sulphurous fuel must be avoided. Baths of molten alloys of lead
and tin are used when very exact temperatures are required,
and when articles have thick and thin parts adjacent. But the
gas furnaces have the same advantages in a more handy form.
Quenching is done in water, oil, or in various hardening mixtures,
and sometimes in solids. Rain water is the principal hardening
agent, but various saline compounds are often added to intensify
its action. Water that has been long in use is preferred to fresh.
Water is generally used cold, but in many cases it is warmed to
about 80° F., as for milling cutters and taps, warmed water
being less liable to crack the cutters than cold. Oil is preferred
to water for small springs, for guns and for many cutters. Mercury
hardens most intensely, because it does not evaporate, and
so does lead or wax for the same reason; water evaporates,
and in the spheroidal state, as steam, leaves contact with the
steel. This is the reason why long and large objects are moved
vertically about in the water during quenching, to bring them
into contact with fresh cold water.</p>

<p>There is a good deal of mystery affected by many of the
hardeners, who are very particular about the composition of
their baths, various oils and salts being used in an infinity of
combinations. Many of these are the result of long and successful
experience, some are of the nature of &ldquo;fads.&rdquo; A change of bath
may involve injury to the steel. The most difficult articles to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page72" id="page72"></a>72</span>
harden are springs, milling cutters, taps, reamers. It would be
easy to give scores of hardening compositions.</p>

<p>Hardening is performed the more efficiently the more rapidly
the quenching is done. In the case of thick objects, however,
especially milling cutters, there is risk of cracking, due to the
difference of temperature on the outside and in the central body
of metal. Rapid hardening is impracticable in such objects.
This is the cause of the distortion of long taps and reamers, and
of their cracking, and explains why their teeth are often protected
with soft soap and other substances.</p>

<p>The presence of the body of heat in a tool is taken advantage
of in the work of tempering. The tool, say a chisel, is dipped,
a length of 2 in. or more being thus hardened and blackened.
It is then removed, and a small area rubbed rapidly with a bit of
grindstone, observations being made of the changing tints which
gradually appear as the heat is communicated from the hot
shank to the cooled end. The heat becomes equalized, and at
the same time the approximate temperature for quenching for
temper is estimated by the appearance of a certain tint; at that
instant the article is plunged and allowed to remain until quite
cold. For every different class of tool a different tint is required.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Blazing off&rdquo; is a particular method of hardening applied to
small springs. The springs are heated and plunged in oils, fats,
or tallow, which is burned off previous to cooling in air, or in the
ashes of the forge, or in oil, or water usually. They are hardened,
reheated and tempered, and the tempering by blazing off is
repeated for heavy springs. The practice varies almost infinitely
with dimensions, quality of steel, and purpose to which the
springs have to be applied.</p>

<p>The range of temper for most cutting tools lies between a pale
straw or yellow, and a light purple or plum colour. The
corresponding range of temperatures is about 430° F. to 530° F.,
respectively. &ldquo;Spring temper&rdquo; is higher, from dark purple to
blue, or 550° F. to 630° F. In many fine tools the range of
temperature possible between good and poor results lies within
from 5° to 10° F.</p>

<p>There is another kind of hardening which is of a superficial
character only&mdash;&ldquo;case hardening.&rdquo; It is employed in cases
where toughness has to be combined with durability of surface.
It is a cementation process, practised on wrought iron and mild
steel, and applied to the link motions of engines, to many pins
and studs, eyes of levers, &amp;c. The articles are hermetically luted
in an iron box, packed with nitrogenous and saline substances
such as potash, bone dust, leather cuttings, and salt. The box is
placed in a furnace, and allowed to remain for periods of from
twelve to thirty-six hours, during which period the surface of the
metal, to a depth of <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">32</span> to <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">16</span> in., is penetrated by the cementing
materials, and converted into steel. The work is then thrown
into water and quenched.</p>

1470 ft., at the northern end of the lake of Annecy, and is 25 m.
by rail N.E. of Aix les Bains. The surrounding country presents
many scenes of beauty. The town itself is a pleasant residence,
and contains a 16th century cathedral church, an 18th century
bishop&rsquo;s palace, a 14th-16th century castle (formerly the residence
of the counts of the Genevois), and the reconstructed
convent of the Visitation, wherein now reposes the body of St
François de Sales (born at the castle of Sales, close by, in 1567;
died at Lyons in 1622), who held the see from 1602 to 1622.
There is also a public library, with 20,000 volumes, and various
scientific collections, and a public garden, with a statue of the
chemist Berthollet (1748-1822), who was born not far off. The
bishop&rsquo;s see of Geneva was transferred hither in 1535, after the
Reformation, but suppressed in 1801, though revived in 1822.
There are factories of linen and cotton goods, and of felt hats,
paper mills, and a celebrated bell foundry at Annecy le Vieux.
This last-named place existed in Roman times. Annecy itself
was in the 10th century the capital of the counts of the Genevois,
from whom it passed in 1401 to the counts of Savoy, and became
French in 1860 on the annexation of Savoy.</p>

<i>Annélides</i>, now used to denote a major phylum or division of
coelomate invertebrate animals. Annelids are segmented worms,
and differ from the Arthropoda (<i>q.v.</i>), which they closely resemble
in many respects, by the possession of a portion of the coelom
traversed by the alimentary canal. In the latter respect, and in
the fact that they frequently develop by a metamorphosis, they
approach the Mollusca (<i>q.v.</i>), but they differ from that group
notably in the occurrence of metameric segmentation affecting
many of the systems of organs. The body-wall is highly muscular
and, except in a few probably specialized cases, possesses
chitinous spines, the setae, which are secreted by the ectoderm
and are embedded in pits of the skin. They possess a modified
anterior end, frequently with special sense organs, forming
a head, a segmented nervous system, consisting of a pair
of anterior, dorsally-placed ganglia, a ring surrounding the

<p><span class="bold">ANNET, PETER<a name="ar34" id="ar34"></a></span> (1693-1769), English deist, is said to have been
born at Liverpool. A schoolmaster by profession, he became
prominent owing to his attacks on orthodox theologians, and his
membership of a semi-theological debating society, the Robin
Hood Society, which met at the &ldquo;Robin Hood and Little John&rdquo;
in Butcher Row. To him has been attributed a work called <i>A
History of the Man after God&rsquo;s own Heart</i> (1761), intended to show
that George II. was insulted by a current comparison with David.
The book is said to have inspired Voltaire&rsquo;s <i>Saul</i>. It is also
attributed to one John Noorthouck (Noorthook). In 1763 he was
condemned for blasphemous libel in his paper called the <i>Free
Enquirer</i> (nine numbers only). After his release he kept a small
school in Lambeth, one of his pupils being James Stephen (1758-1832),
who became master in Chancery. Annet died on the 18th
of January 1769. He stands between the earlier philosophic

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANNEXATION<a name="ar35" id="ar35"></a></span> (Lat. <i>ad</i>, to, and <i>nexus</i>, joining), in international
law, the act by which a state adds territory to its dominions;
the term is also used generally as a synonym for acquisition. The
assumption of a protectorate over another state, or of a sphere of
influence, is not strictly annexation, the latter implying the
complete displacement in the annexed territory of the government
or state by which it was previously ruled. Annexation may be
the consequence of a voluntary cession from one state to another,
or of conversion from a protectorate or sphere of influence, or of
mere occupation in uncivilized regions, or of conquest. The
cession of Alsace-Lorraine to Germany by France, although
brought about by the war of 1870, was for the purposes of international
law a voluntary cession. Under the treaty of the 17th of
December 1885, between the French republic and the queen of
Madagascar, a French protectorate was established over this
island. In 1896 this protectorate was converted by France into
an annexation, and Madagascar then became &ldquo;French territory.&rdquo;
The formal annexation of Bosnia-Herzegovina by Austria (Oct. 5,
1908) was an unauthorized conversion of an &ldquo;occupation&rdquo;
authorized by the Treaty of Berlin (1878), which had, however,
for years operated as a <i>de facto</i> annexation. A recent case of
conquest was that effected by the South African War of 1899-1902,
in which the Transvaal republic and the Orange Free
State were extinguished, first <i>de facto</i> by occupation of the whole
of their territory, and then <i>de jure</i> by terms of surrender entered
into by the Boer generals acting as a government.</p>

<p>By annexation, as between civilized peoples, the annexing state
takes over the whole succession with the rights and obligations
attaching to the ceded territory, subject only to any modifying
conditions contained in the treaty of cession. These, however,
are binding only as between the parties to them. In the case of
the annexation of the territories of the Transvaal republic and
Orange Free State, a rather complicated situation arose out of
the facts, on the one hand, that the ceding states closed their own
existence and left no recourse to third parties against the previous
ruling authority, and, on the other, that, having no means owing
to the <i>de facto</i> British occupation, of raising money by taxation,
the dispossessed governments raised money by selling certain
securities, more especially a large holding of shares in the South
African Railway Company, to neutral purchasers. The British
government repudiated these sales as having been made by a
government which the British government had already displaced.
The question of at what point, in a war of conquest, the state
succession becomes operative is one of great delicacy. As early
as the 6th of January 1900, the high commissioner at Cape Town
issued a proclamation giving notice that H.M. government would
&ldquo;not recognize as valid or effectual&rdquo; any conveyance, transfer
or transmission of any property made by the government of the
Transvaal republic or Orange Free State subsequently to the 10th
of October 1899, the date of the commencement of the war. A
proclamation forbidding transactions with a state which might
still be capable of maintaining its independence could obviously
bind only those subject to the authority of the state issuing it.
Like paper blockades (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Blockade</a></span>) and fictitious occupations
of territory, such premature proclamations are viewed by international
jurists as not being <i>jure gentium</i>. The proclamation was
succeeded, on the 9th of March 1900, by another of the high
commissioner at Cape Town, reiterating the notice, but confining
it to &ldquo;lands, railways, mines or mining rights.&rdquo; And on the 1st
of September 1900 Lord Roberts proclaimed at Pretoria the
annexation of the territories of the Transvaal republic to the
British dominions. That the war continued for nearly two years
after this proclamation shows how fictitious the claim of annexation
was. The difficulty which arose out of the transfer of the
South African Railway shares held by the Transvaal government
was satisfactorily terminated by the purchase by the British
government of the total capital of the company from the different
groups of shareholders (see on this case, Sir Thomas Barclay, <i>Law
Quarterly Review</i>, July 1905; and Professor Westlake, in the same
<i>Review</i>, October 1905).</p>

<p>In a judgment of the judicial committee of the privy council in
1899 (<i>Coote</i> v. <i>Sprigg</i>, A.C. 572), Lord Chancellor Halsbury made
an important distinction as regards the obligations of state
succession. The case in question was a claim of title against the
crown, represented by the government of Cape Colony. It was
made by persons holding a concession of certain rights in eastern
Pondoland from a native chief. Before the grantees had taken up
their grant by acts of possession, Pondoland was annexed to Cape
Colony. The colonial government refused to recognize the grant
on different grounds, the chief of them being that the concession
conferred no legal rights before the annexation and therefore
could confer none afterwards, a sufficiently good ground in itself.
The judicial committee, however, rested its decision chiefly on the
allegation that the acquisition of the territory was an act of state
and that &ldquo;no municipal court had authority to enforce such an
obligation&rdquo; as the duty of the new government to respect existing
titles. &ldquo;It is no answer,&rdquo; said Lord Halsbury, &ldquo;to say that by
the ordinary principles of international law private property is
respected by the sovereign which accepts the cession and assumes
the duties and legal obligations of the former sovereign with
respect to such private property within the ceded territory. All
that can be meant by such a proposition is that according to the
well-understood rules of international law a change of sovereignty
by cession ought not to affect private property, but no municipal
tribunal has authority to enforce such an obligation. And if
there is either an express or a well-understood bargain between
the ceding potentate and the government to which the cession is
made that private property shall be respected, that is only a
bargain which can be enforced by sovereign against sovereign in
the ordinary course of diplomatic pressure.&rdquo; In an editorial note
on this case the <i>Law Quarterly Review</i> of Jan. 1900 (p. 1),
dissenting from the view of the judicial committee that &ldquo;no
municipal tribunal has authority to enforce such an obligation,&rdquo;
the writer observes that &ldquo;we can read this only as meant to lay
down that, on the annexation of territory even by peaceable
cession, there is a total abeyance of justice until the will of the
annexing power is expressly made known; and that, although
the will of that power is commonly to respect existing private
rights, there is no rule or presumption to that effect of which any
court must or indeed can take notice.&rdquo; So construed the doctrine
is not only contrary to international law, but according to so
authoritative an exponent of the common law as Sir F. Pollock,
there is no warrant for it in English common law.</p>

<p>An interesting point of American constitutional law has arisen
out of the cession of the Philippines to the United States, through
the fact that the federal constitution does not lend itself to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>74</span>
exercise by the federal congress of unlimited powers, such as are
vested in the British parliament. The sole authority for the
powers of the federal congress is a written constitution with
defined powers. Anything done in excess of those powers is null
and void. The Supreme Court of the United States, on the other
hand, has declared that, by the constitution, a government is
ordained and established &ldquo;for the United States of America&rdquo;
and not for countries outside their limits (<i>Ross&rsquo;s Case</i>, 140 U.S.
453, 464), and that no such power to legislate for annexed
territories as that vested in the British crown in council is enjoyed
by the president of the United States (<i>Field</i> v. <i>Clark</i>, 143 U.S. 649,
692). Every detail connected with the administration of the
territories acquired from Spain under the treaty of Paris
(December 10, 1898) has given rise to minute discussion.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANNICERIS,<a name="ar36" id="ar36"></a></span> a Greek philosopher of the Cyrenaic school.
There is no certain information as to his date, but from the
statement that he was a disciple of Paraebates it seems likely
that he was a contemporary of Alexander the Great. A follower of
Aristippus, he denied that pleasure is the general end of human
life. To each separate action there is a particular end, namely
the pleasure which actually results from it. Secondly, pleasure
is not merely the negation of pain, inasmuch as death ends all
pain and yet cannot be regarded as pleasure. There is, however,
an absolute pleasure in certain virtues such as belong to the love
of country, parents and friends. In these relations a man will
have pleasure, even though it may result in painful and even
fatal consequences. Friendship is not merely for the satisfaction
of our needs, but is in itself a source of pleasure. He maintains
further, in opposition to most of the Cyrenaic school, that
wisdom or prudence alone is an insufficient guarantee against
error. The wise man is he who has acquired a habit of wise
action; human wisdom is liable to lapses at any moment.
Diogenes Laertius says that Anniceris ransomed Plato from
Dionysius, tyrant of Syracuse, for twenty minas. If we are
right in placing Anniceris in the latter half of the 4th century,
it is clear that the reference here is to an earlier Anniceris, who,
according to Aelian, was a celebrated charioteer.</p>

belonged to a Swabian family, and was educated at Bamberg.
He became confessor to the emperor Henry III., who appointed
him archbishop of Cologne in 1056. He took a prominent part in
the government of Germany during the minority of King Henry IV.,
and was the leader of the party which in 1062 seized the person
of Henry, and deprived his mother, the empress Agnes, of
power. For a short time Anno exercised the chief authority in
the kingdom, but he was soon obliged to share this with Adalbert,
archbishop of Bremen, retaining for himself the supervision of
Henry&rsquo;s education and the title of <i>magister</i>. The office of
chancellor of the kingdom of Italy was at this period regarded as
an appanage of the archbishopric of Cologne, and this was probably
the reason why Anno had a considerable share in settling the
papal dispute in 1064. He declared Alexander II. to be the
rightful pope at a synod held at Mantua in May 1064, and took
other steps to secure his recognition. Returning to Germany,
he found the chief power in the hands of Adalbert, and as he was
disliked by the young king, he left the court but returned and
regained some of his former influence when Adalbert fell from
power in 1066. He succeeded in putting down a rising against
his authority in Cologne in 1074, and it was reported he had
allied himself with William the Conqueror, king of England,
against the emperor. Having cleared himself of this charge,
Anno took no further part in public business, and died at Cologne
on the 4th of December 1075. He was buried in the monastery of
Siegburg and was canonized in 1183 by Pope Lucius III. He
was a founder of monasteries and a builder of churches, advocated
clerical celibacy and was a strict disciplinarian. He was a man
of great energy and ability, whose action in recognizing Alexander
II. was of the utmost consequence for Henry IV. and for
Germany.</p>

for distribution amongst officials and the support of the soldiery.</p>

<p>In order to ensure a supply of corn sufficient to enable it to be
sold at a very low price, it was procured in large quantities from
Umbria, Etruria and Sicily. Almost down to the times of the
empire, the care of the corn-supply formed part of the aedile&rsquo;s
duties, although in 440 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (if the statement in Livy iv. 12, 13
is correct, which is doubtful) the senate appointed a special
officer, called <i>praefectus annonae</i>, with greatly extended powers.
As a consequence of the second Punic War, Roman agriculture
was at a standstill; accordingly, recourse was had to Sicily and
Sardinia (the first two Roman provinces) in order to keep up the
supply of corn; a tax of one-tenth was imposed on it, and its
export to any country except Italy forbidden. The price at
which the corn was sold was always moderate; the corn law of
Gracchus (123 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) made it absurdly low, and Clodius (58 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>)
bestowed it gratuitously. The number of the recipients of this
free gift grew so enormously, that both Caesar and Augustus were
obliged to reduce it. From the time of Augustus to the end of
the empire the number of those who were entitled to receive a
monthly allowance of corn on presenting a ticket was 200,000.
In the 3rd century, bread formed the dole. A <i>praefectus annonae</i>
was appointed by Augustus to superintend the corn-supply; he
was assisted by a large staff in Rome and the provinces, and had
jurisdiction in all matters connected with the corn-market. The
office lasted till the latest times of the empire.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANNONAY,<a name="ar42" id="ar42"></a></span> a town of south-eastern France, in the north of the
department of Ardèche, 50 m. S. of Lyons by the Paris-Lyons
railway. Pop. (1906) 15,403. Annonay is built on the hill
overlooking the meeting of the deep gorges of the Déôme and the
Cance, the waters of which supply power to the factories of the
town. By means of a dam across the Ternay, an affluent of the
Déôme, to the north-west of the town, a reservoir is provided,
in which an additional supply of water, for both industrial and
domestic purposes, is stored. At Annonay there is an obelisk
in honour of the brothers Montgolfier, inventors of the balloon,
who were natives of the place. A tribunal of commerce, a board
of trade-arbitrators, a branch of the Bank of France, and
chambers of commerce and of arts and manufactures are among
the public institutions. Annonay is the principal industrial
centre of its department, the chief manufactures being those of
leather, especially for gloves, paper, silk and silk goods, and
flour. Chemical manures, glue, gelatine, brushes, chocolate and
candles are also produced.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANNOY<a name="ar43" id="ar43"></a></span> (like the French <i>ennui</i>, a word traced by etymologists
to a Lat. phrase, <i>in odio esse</i>, to be &ldquo;in hatred&rdquo; or hateful of
someone), to vex or affect with irritation. In the sense of
&ldquo;nuisance,&rdquo; the noun &ldquo;annoyance,&rdquo; apart from its obvious
meaning, is found in the English &ldquo;Jury of Annoyance&rdquo;
appointed by an act of 1754 to report upon obstructions in the
highways.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANNUITY<a name="ar44" id="ar44"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>annus</i>, a year), a periodical payment,
made annually, or at more frequent intervals, either for a fixed
term of years, or during the continuance of a given life, or a combination
of lives. In technical language an annuity is said to be
payable for an assigned <i>status</i>, this being a general word chosen
in preference to such words as &ldquo;time,&rdquo; &ldquo;term&rdquo; or &ldquo;period,&rdquo;
because it may include more readily either a term of years
certain, or a life or combination of lives. The magnitude of the
annuity is the sum to be paid (and received) in the course of each
year. Thus, if £100 is to be received each year by a person, he is
said to have &ldquo;an annuity of £100.&rdquo; If the payments are made
half-yearly, it is sometimes said that he has &ldquo;a half-yearly
annuity of £100&rdquo;; but to avoid ambiguity, it is more commonly
said he has an annuity of £100, payable by half-yearly instalments.
The former expression, if clearly understood, is preferable
on account of its brevity. So we may have quarterly,
monthly, weekly, daily annuities, when the annuity is payable
by quarterly, monthly, weekly or daily instalments. An annuity
is considered as accruing during each instant of the status for
which it is enjoyed, although it is only payable at fixed intervals.
If the enjoyment of an annuity is postponed until after the lapse
of a certain number of years, the annuity is said to be deferred.
If an annuity, instead of being payable at the end of each year,
half-year, &amp;c., is payable in advance, it is called an annuity-due.</p>

<p>If an annuity is payable for a term of years independent of
any contingency, it is called an <i>annuity certain</i>; if it is to continue
for ever, it is called a <i>perpetuity</i>; and if in the latter case
it is not to commence until after a term of years, it is called a
<i>deferred perpetuity</i>. An annuity depending on the continuance
of an assigned life or lives, is sometimes called a life annuity;
but more commonly the simple term &ldquo;annuity&rdquo; is understood
to mean a life annuity, unless the contrary is stated. A life
annuity, to cease in any event after a certain term of years, is
called a <i>temporary annuity</i>. The holder of an annuity is called
an annuitant, and the person on whose life the annuity depends
is called the nominee.</p>

<p>If not otherwise stated, it is always understood that an annuity
is payable yearly, and that the annual payment (or rent, as it is
sometimes called) is £1. It is, however, customary to consider
the annual payment to be, not £1, but simply 1, the reader
supplying whatever monetary unit he pleases, whether pound,
dollar, franc, Thaler, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The annuity is the totality of the payments to be made (and
received), and is so understood by all writers on the subject;
but some have also used the word to denote an individual
payment (or rent), speaking, for instance, of the first or second
year&rsquo;s annuity,&mdash;a practice which is calculated to introduce
confusion and should therefore be carefully avoided.</p>

<p>Instances of perpetuities are the dividends upon the public
stocks in England, France and some other countries. Thus,
although it is usual to speak of £100 consols, the reality is the
yearly dividend which the government pays by quarterly instalments.
The practice of the French in this, as in many other
matters, is more logical. In speaking of their public funds (<i>rentes</i>)
they do not mention the ideal capital sum, but speak of the
annuity or annual payment that is received by the public
creditor. Other instances of perpetuities are the incomes derived
from the debenture stocks of railway companies, also the feu-duties
commonly payable on house property in Scotland. The
number of years&rsquo; purchase which the perpetual annuities granted
by a government or a railway company realize in the open
market, forms a very simple test of the credit of the various
governments or railways.</p>

<p><i>Terminable Annuities</i> are employed in the system of British
public finance as a means of reducing the National Debt (<i>q.v.</i>).
This result is attained by substituting for a perpetual annual
charge (or one lasting until the capital which it represents can
be paid off <i>en bloc</i>), an annual charge of a larger amount, but
lasting for a short term. The latter is so calculated as to pay off,
during its existence, the capital which it replaces, with interest
at an assumed or agreed rate, and under specified conditions.
The practical effect of the substitution of a terminable annuity
for an obligation of longer currency is to bind the present generation
of citizens to increase its own obligations in the present and
near future in order to diminish those of its successors. This
end might be attained in other ways; for instance, by setting
aside out of revenue a fixed annual sum for the purchase and
cancellation of debt (Pitt&rsquo;s method, in intention), or by fixing
the annual debt charge at a figure sufficient to provide a margin
for reduction of the principal of the debt beyond the amount
required for interest (Sir Stafford Northcote&rsquo;s method), or by
providing an annual surplus of revenue over expenditure (the
&ldquo;Old Sinking Fund&rdquo;), available for the same purpose. All
these methods have been tried in the course of British financial
history, and the second and third of them are still employed;
but on the whole the method of terminable annuities has been
the one preferred by chancellors of the exchequer and by parliament.</p>

<p>Terminable annuities, as employed by the British government,
fall under two heads:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Those issued to, or held by private
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page76" id="page76"></a>76</span>
persons; (<i>b</i>) those held by government departments or by funds
under government control. The important difference between
these two classes is that an annuity under (<i>a</i>), once created,
cannot be modified except with the holder&rsquo;s consent, <i>i.e.</i> is
practically unalterable without a breach of public faith; whereas
an annuity under (<i>b</i>) can, if necessary, be altered by interdepartmental arrangement under the authority of parliament.
Thus annuities of class (<i>a</i>) fulfil most perfectly the object of the
system as explained above; while those of class (<i>b</i>) have the
advantage that in times of emergency their operation can be
suspended without any inconvenience or breach of faith, with
the result that the resources of government can on such occasions
be materially increased, apart from any additional taxation.
For this purpose it is only necessary to retain as a charge on the
income of the year a sum equal to the (smaller) perpetual charge
which was originally replaced by the (larger) terminable charge,
whereupon the difference between the two amounts is temporarily
released, while ultimately the increased charge is extended for
a period equal to that for which it is suspended. Annuities of
class (<i>a</i>) were first instituted in 1808, but are at present mainly
regulated by an act of 1829. They may be granted either for
a specified life, or two lives, or for an arbitrary term of years;
and the consideration for them may take the form either of cash
or of government stock, the latter being cancelled when the
annuity is set up. Annuities (<i>b</i>) held by government departments
date from 1863. They have been created in exchange for permanent
debt surrendered for cancellation, the principal operations
having been effected in 1863, 1867, 1870, 1874, 1883 and
1899. Annuities of this class do not affect the public at all,
except of course in their effect on the market for government
securities. They are merely financial operations between the
government, in its capacity as the banker of savings banks and
other funds, and itself, in the capacity of custodian of the national
finances. Savings bank depositors are not concerned with the
manner in which government invests their money, their rights
being confined to the receipt of interest and the repayment of
deposits upon specified conditions. The case is, however,
different as regards forty millions of consols (included in the
above figures), belonging to suitors in chancery, which were
cancelled and replaced by a terminable annuity in 1883. As the
liability to the suitors in that case was for a specified amount of
stock, special arrangements were made to ensure the ultimate
replacement of the precise amount of stock cancelled.</p>

<p><i>Annuity Calculations.</i>&mdash;The mathematical theory of life
annuities is based upon a knowledge of the rate of mortality
among mankind in general, or among the particular class of
persons on whose lives the annuities depend. It involves a
mathematical treatment too complicated to be dealt with fully
in this place, and in practice it has been reduced to the form of
tables, which vary in different places, but which are easily
accessible. The history of the subject may, however, be sketched.
Abraham Demoivre, in his <i>Annuities on Lives</i>, propounded a very
simple law of mortality which is to the effect that, out of 86
children born alive, 1 will die every year until the last dies
between the ages of 85 and 86. This law agreed sufficiently well
at the middle ages of life with the mortality deduced from the
best observations of his time; but, as observations became more
exact, the approximation was found to be not sufficiently close.
This was particularly the case when it was desired to obtain the
value of joint life, contingent or other complicated benefits.
Therefore Demoivre&rsquo;s law is entirely devoid of practical utility.
No simple formula has yet been discovered that will represent
the rate of mortality with sufficient accuracy.</p>

<p>The rate of mortality at each age is, therefore, in practice
usually determined by a series of figures deduced from observation;
and the value of an annuity at any age is found from these
numbers by means of a series of arithmetical calculations. The
mortality table here given is an example of modern use.</p>

<p>The first writer who is known to have attempted to obtain, on
correct mathematical principles, the value of a life annuity, was
Jan De Witt, grand pensionary of Holland and West Friesland.
Our knowledge of his writings on the subject is derived from two
papers contributed by Frederick Hendriks to the <i>Assurance
Magazine</i>, vol. ii. p. 222, and vol. in. p. 93. The former of these
contains a translation of De Witt&rsquo;s report upon the value of life
annuities, which was prepared in consequence of the resolution
passed by the states-general, on the 25th of April 1671, to negotiate
funds by life annuities, and which was distributed to the
members on the 30th of July 1671. The latter contains the
translation of a number of letters addressed by De Witt to
Burgomaster Johan Hudde, bearing dates from September 1670
to October 1671. The existence of De Witt&rsquo;s report was well
known among his contemporaries, and Hendriks collected a
number of extracts from various authors referring to it; but the
report is not contained in any collection of his works extant, and
had been entirely lost for 180 years, until Hendriks discovered it
among the state archives of Holland in company with the letters
to Hudde. It is a document of extreme interest, and (notwithstanding
some inaccuracies in the reasoning) of very great merit,
more especially considering that it was the very first document
on the subject that was ever written.</p>

<p>It appears that it had long been the practice in Holland for
life annuities to be granted to nominees of any age, in the constant
proportion of double the rate of interest allowed on stock;
that is to say, if the towns were borrowing money at 6%, they
would be willing to grant a life annuity at 12%, and so on.
De Witt states that &ldquo;annuities have been sold, even in the
present century, first at six years&rsquo; purchase, then at seven and
eight; and that the majority of all life annuities now current
at the country&rsquo;s expense were obtained at nine years&rsquo; purchase&rdquo;;
but that the price had been increased in the course of a few
years from eleven years&rsquo; purchase to twelve, and from twelve to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page77" id="page77"></a>77</span>
fourteen. He also states that the rate of interest had been
successively reduced from 6¼ to 5%, and then to 4%. The
principal object of his report is to prove that, taking interest at
4%, a life annuity was worth at least sixteen years&rsquo; purchase;
and, in fact, that an annuitant purchasing an annuity for the
life of a young and healthy nominee at sixteen years&rsquo; purchase,
made an excellent bargain. It may be mentioned that he argues
that it is more to the advantage, both of the country and of the
private investor, that the public loans should be raised by way of
grant of life annuities rather than perpetual annuities. It appears
conclusively from De Witt&rsquo;s correspondence with Hudde, that
the rate of mortality assumed as the basis of his calculations
was deduced from careful examination of the mortality that had
actually prevailed among the nominees on whose lives annuities
had been granted in former years. De Witt appears to have
come to the conclusion that the probability of death is the
same in any half-year from the age of 3 to 53 inclusive; that
in the next ten years, from 53 to 63, the probability is greater
in the ratio of 3 to 2; that in the next ten years, from 63 to 73,
it is greater in the ratio of 2 to 1; and in the next seven years,
from 73 to 80, it is greater in the ratio of 3 to 1; and he places
the limit of human life at 80. If a mortality table of the usual
form is deduced from these suppositions, out of 212 persons
alive at the age of 3, 2 will die every year up to 53, 3 in each of
the ten years from 53 to 63, 4 in each of the next ten years from
63 to 73, and 6 in each of the next seven years from 73 to 80,
when all will be dead.</p>

<p>De Witt calculates the value of an annuity in the following
way. Assume that annuities on 10,000 lives each ten years of
age, which satisfy the Hm mortality table, have been purchased.
Of these nominees 79 will die before attaining the age of 11,
and no annuity payment will be made in respect of them; none
will die between the ages of 11 and 12, so that annuities will be
paid for one year on 9921 lives; 40 attain the age of 12 and
die before 13, so that two payments will be made with respect
to these lives. Reasoning in this way we see that the annuities
on 35 of the nominees will be payable for three years; on 40
for four years, and so on. Proceeding thus to the end of the
table, 15 nominees attain the age of 95, 5 of whom die before
the age of 96, so that 85 payments will be paid in respect of
these 5 lives. Of the survivors all die before attaining the age
of 97, so that the annuities on these lives will be payable for 86
years. Having previously calculated a table of the values of
annuities certain for every number of years up to 86, the value
of all the annuities on the 10,000 nominees will be found by
taking 40 times the value of an annuity for 2 years, 35 times
the value of an annuity for 3 years, and so on&mdash;the last term
being the value of 10 annuities for 86 years&mdash;and adding them
together; and the value of an annuity on one of the nominees
will then be found by dividing by 10,000. Before leaving the
subject of De Witt, we may mention that we find in the correspondence
a distinct suggestion of the law of mortality that
bears the name of Demoivre. In De Witt&rsquo;s letter, dated the
27th of October 1671 (<i>Ass. Mag</i>. vol. iii. p. 107), he speaks of a
&ldquo;provisional hypothesis&rdquo; suggested by Hudde, that out of
80 young lives (who, from the context, may be taken as of the
age 6) about 1 dies annually. In strictness, therefore, the law
in question might be more correctly termed Hudde&rsquo;s than
Demoivre&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>De Witt&rsquo;s report being thus of the nature of an unpublished
state paper, although it contributed to its author&rsquo;s reputation,
did not contribute to advance the exact knowledge of the
subject; and the author to whom the credit must be given of
first showing how to calculate the value of an annuity on correct
principles is Edmund Halley. He gave the first approximately
correct mortality table (deduced from the records of the numbers
of deaths and baptisms in the city of Breslau), and showed how
it might be employed to calculate the value of an annuity on
the life of a nominee of any age (see <i>Phil. Trans</i>. 1693; <i>Ass.
Mag</i>. vol. xviii.).</p>

<p>Previously to Halley&rsquo;s time, and apparently for many years
subsequently, all dealings with life annuities were based upon
mere conjectural estimates. The earliest known reference to
any estimate of the value of life annuities rose out of the requirements
of the Falcidian law, which (40 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>) was adopted in the
Roman empire, and which declared that a testator should not
give more than three-fourths of his property in legacies, so that
at least one-fourth must go to his legal representatives. It is
easy to see how it would occasionally become necessary, while
this law was in force, to value life annuities charged upon a
testator&rsquo;s estate. Aemilius Macer (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 230) states that the
method which had been in common use at that time was as
follows:&mdash;From the earliest age until 30 take 30 years&rsquo; purchase,
and for each age after 30 deduct 1 year. It is obvious that no
consideration of compound interest can have entered into this
estimate; and it is easy to see that it is equivalent to assuming
that all persons who attain the age of 30 will certainly live to
the age of 60, and then certainly die. Compared with this estimate,
that which was propounded by the praetorian prefect
Ulpian was a great improvement. His table is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">Here also we have no reason to suppose that the element of
interest was taken into consideration; and the assumption,
that between the ages of 40 and 50 each addition of a year to the
nominee&rsquo;s age diminishes the value of the annuity by one year&rsquo;s
purchase, is equivalent to assuming that there is no probability
of the nominee dying between the ages of 40 and 50. Considered,
however, simply as a table of the average duration of
life, the values are fairly accurate. At all events, no more
correct estimate appears to have been arrived at until the close
of the 17th century.</p>

<p><i>Commutation tables</i>, aptly so named in 1840 by Augustus
De Morgan (see his paper &ldquo;On the Calculation of Single Life
Contingencies,&rdquo; <i>Assurance Magazine</i>, xii. 328), show the proportion
in which a benefit due at one age ought to be changed,
so as to retain the same value and be due at another age. The
earliest known specimen of a commutation table is contained
in William Dale&rsquo;s <i>Introduction to the Study of the Doctrine of
Annuities</i>, published in 1772. A full account of this work is
given by F. Hendriks in the second number of the <i>Assurance
Magazine</i>, pp. 15-17. William Morgan&rsquo;s <i>Treatise on Assurances</i>,
1779, also contains a commutation table. Morgan gives the
table as furnishing a convenient means of checking the correctness
of the values of annuities found by the ordinary process.
It may be assumed that he was aware that the table might be
used for the direct calculation of annuities; but he appears to
have been ignorant of its other uses.</p>

<p>The first author who fully developed the powers of the table
was John Nicholas Tetens, a native of Schleswig, who in 1785,
while professor of philosophy and mathematics at Kiel, published
in the German language an <i>Introduction to the Calculation of
Life Annuities and Assurances</i>. This work appears to have been
quite unknown in England until F. Hendriks gave, in the first
number of the <i>Assurance Magazine</i>, pp. 1-20 (Sept. 1850), an
account of it, with a translation of the passages describing the
construction and use of the commutation table, and a sketch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>78</span>
of the author&rsquo;s life and writings, to which we refer the reader
who desires fuller information. It may be mentioned here that
Tetens also gave only a specimen table, apparently not imagining
that persons using his work would find it extremely useful to
have a series of commutation tables, calculated and printed
ready for use.</p>

<p>The use of the commutation table was independently developed
in England-apparently between the years 1788 and 1811&mdash;
by George Barrett, of Petworth, Sussex, who was the son of a
yeoman farmer, and was himself a village schoolmaster, and
afterwards farm steward or bailiff. It has been usual to consider
Barrett as the originator in England of the method of calculating
the values of annuities by means of a commutation table, and
this method is accordingly sometimes called Barrett&rsquo;s method.
(It is also called the commutation method and the columnar
method.) Barrett&rsquo;s method of calculating annuities was explained
by him to Francis Baily in the year 1811, and was first
made known to the world in a paper written by the latter and
read before the Royal Society in 1812.</p>

<p>By what has been universally considered an unfortunate
error of judgment, this paper was not recommended by the
council of the Royal Society to be printed, but it was given by
Baily as an appendix to the second issue (in 1813) of his work
on life annuities and assurances. Barrett had calculated extensive
tables, and with Baily&rsquo;s aid attempted to get them published
by subscription, but without success; and the only printed
tables calculated according to his manner, besides the specimen
tables given by Baily, are the tables contained in Babbage&rsquo;s
<i>Comparative View of the various Institutions for the Assurance of
Lives</i>, 1826.</p>

<p>In the year 1825 Griffith Davies published his <i>Tables of Life
Contingencies</i>, a work which contains, among others, two tables,
which are confessedly derived from Baily&rsquo;s explanation of
Barrett&rsquo;s tables.</p>

<p>Those who desire to pursue the subject further can refer to the
appendix to Baily&rsquo;s <i>Life Annuities and Assurances</i>, De Morgan&rsquo;s
paper &ldquo;On the Calculation of Single Life Contingencies,&rdquo; <i>Assurance
Magazine</i>, xii. 348-349; Gray&rsquo;s <i>Tables and Formulae</i> chap. viii.;

<p>The principal commutation tables published in England are
contained in the following works:&mdash;David Jones, <i>Value of Annuities
and Reversionary Payments</i>, issued in parts by the Useful Knowledge
Society, completed in 1843; Jenkin Jones, <i>New Rate of Mortality</i>,
1843; G. Davies, <i>Treatise on Annuities</i>, 1825 (issued 1855); David
Chisholm, <i>Commutation Tables</i>, 1858; Nelson&rsquo;s <i>Contributions to
Vital Statistics</i>, 1857; Jardine Henry, <i>Government Life Annuity
Commutation Tables</i>, 1866 and 1873; <i>Institute of Actuaries Life
Tables</i>, 1872; R.P. Hardy, <i>Valuation Tables</i>, 1873; and Dr William
Farr&rsquo;s contributions to the sixth (1844), twelfth (1849), and twentieth
(1857) <i>Reports</i> of the Registrar General in England (English Tables,
I. 2), and to the <i>English Life Table</i>, 1864.</p>

<p>The theory of annuities may be further studied in the discussions
in the English <i>Journal of the Institute of Actuaries</i>. The institute
was founded in the year 1848, the first sessional meeting being held
in January 1849. Its establishment has contributed in various ways
to promote the study of the theory of life contingencies. Among
these may be specified the following:&mdash;Before it was formed, students
of the subject worked for the most part alone, and without any
concert; and when any person had made an improvement in the
theory, it had little chance of becoming publicly known unless he
wrote a formal treatise on the whole subject. But the formation of
the institute led to much greater interchange of opinion among
actuaries, and afforded them a ready means of making known to
their professional associates any improvements, real or supposed,
that they thought they had made. Again, the discussions which
follow the reading of papers before the institute have often served,
first, to bring out into bold relief differences of opinion that were
previously unsuspected, and afterwards to soften down those differences,&mdash;to
correct extreme opinions in every direction, and to bring
about a greater agreement of opinion on many important subjects.
In no way, probably, have the objects of the institute been so
effectually advanced as by the publication of its <i>Journal</i>. The first
number of this work, which was originally called the <i>Assurance
Magazine</i>, appeared in September 1850, and it has been continued
quarterly down to the present time. It was originated by the public
spirit of two well-known actuaries (Mr Charles Jellicoe and Mr
Samuel Brown), and was adopted as the organ of the Institute of
Actuaries in the year 1852, and called the <i>Assurance Magazine and
Journal of the Institute of Actuaries</i>, Mr Jellicoe continuing to be the
editor,&mdash;a post he held until the year 1867, when he was succeeded
by Mr T.B. Sprague (who contributed to the 9th edition of this
Encyclopaedia an elaborate article on &ldquo;Annuities,&rdquo; on which the
above account is based). The name was again changed in 1866, the
words &ldquo;Assurance Magazine&rdquo; being dropped; but in the following
year it was considered desirable to resume these, for the purpose of
showing the continuity of the publication, and it is now called the
<i>Journal of the Institute of Actuaries and Assurance Magazine</i>. This
work contains not only the papers read before the institute (to which
have been appended of late years short abstracts of the discussions on
them), and many original papers which were unsuitable for reading,
together with correspondence, but also reprints of many papers
published elsewhere, which from various causes had become difficult
of access to the ordinary reader, among which may be specified
various papers which originally appeared in the <i>Philosophical
Transactions</i>, the <i>Philosophical Magazine</i>, the <i>Mechanics&rsquo; Magazine</i>,
and the <i>Companion to the Almanac</i>; also translations of various
papers from the French, German, and Danish. Among the useful
objects which the continuous publication of the <i>Journal</i> of the
institute has served, we may specify in particular two:&mdash;that any
supposed improvement in the theory was effectually submitted to
the criticisms of the whole actuarial profession, and its real value
speedily discovered; and that any real improvement, whether
great or small, being placed on record, successive writers have been
able, one after the other, to take it up and develop it, each commencing
where the previous one had left off.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANNULAR, ANNULATE,<a name="ar45" id="ar45"></a></span> &amp;c. (Lat. <i>annulus</i>, a ring), ringed.
&ldquo;Annulate&rdquo; is used in botany and zoology in connexion with
certain plants, worms, &amp;c. (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Annelida</a></span>), either marked with
rings or composed of ring-like segments. The word &ldquo;annulated&rdquo;
is also used in, heraldry and architecture. An annulated cross
is one with the points ending in an &ldquo;annulet&rdquo; (an heraldic ring,
supposed to be taken from a coat of mail), while the annulet in
architecture is a small fillet round a column, which encircles the
lower part of the Doric capital immediately above the neck or
trachelium. The word &ldquo;annulus&rdquo; (for &ldquo;ring&rdquo;) is itself used technically
in geometry, astronomy, &amp;c., and the adjective &ldquo;annular&rdquo;
corresponds. An <i>annular space</i> is that between an inner and outer
ring. The <i>annular finger</i> is the ring finger. An <i>annular eclipse</i> is
an eclipse of the sun in which the visible part of the latter completely
encircles the dark body of the moon; for this to happen,
the centres of the sun and moon, and the point on the earth
where the observer is situated, must be collinear. Certain
nebulae having the form of a ring are also called &ldquo;annular.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANNUNCIATION,<a name="ar46" id="ar46"></a></span> the announcement made by the angel

is celebrated on the 25th of March. The first authentic allusions
to it are in a canon, of the council of Toledo (656), and another
of the council of Constantinople &ldquo;in Trullo&rdquo; (692), forbidding
the celebration of all festivals in Lent, excepting the Lord&rsquo;s day
and the Feast of the Annunciation. An earlier origin has been
claimed for it on the ground that it is mentioned in sermons of
Athanasius and of Gregory Thaumaturgus, but both of these
documents are now admitted to be spurious. A synod held at
Worcester, England (1240), forbade all servile work on this
feast day. See further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Lady Day</a></span>.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANNUNZIO, GABRIELE D&rsquo;<a name="ar47" id="ar47"></a></span> (1863-&emsp;&emsp;), Italian novelist and
poet, of Dalmatian extraction, was born at Pescara (Abruzzi) in
1863. The first years of his youth were spent in the freedom of
the open fields; at sixteen he was sent to school in Tuscany.
While still at school he published a small volume of verses called
<i>Primo Vere</i> (1879), in which, side by side with some almost
brutal imitations of Lorenzo Stecchetti, the then fashionable
poet of <i>Postuma</i>, were some translations from the Latin, distinguished
by such agile grace that Giuseppe Chiarini on reading
them brought the unknown youth before the public in an enthusiastic article. The young poet then went to Rome, where he
was received as one of their own by the <i>Cronaca Bizantina</i> group
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Carducci</a></span>). Here he published <i>Canto Nuovo</i> (1882), <i>Terra
Vergine</i> (1882), <i>L&rsquo; Intermezzo di Rime</i> (1883), <i>Il Libro delle
Vergini</i> (1884), and the greater part of the short stories that were
afterwards collected under the general title of <i>San Pantaleone</i>
(1886). In <i>Canto Nuovo</i> we have admirable poems full of
pulsating youth and the promise of power, some descriptive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page79" id="page79"></a>79</span>
of the sea and some of the Abruzzi landscape, commented on
and completed in prose by <i>Terra Vergine</i>, the latter a collection
of short stories dealing in radiant language with the peasant life
of the author&rsquo;s native province. With the <i>Intermezzo di Rime</i> we
have the beginning of d&rsquo;Annunzio&rsquo;s second and characteristic
manner. His conception of style was new, and he chose to
express all the most subtle vibrations of voluptuous life. Both
style and contents began to startle his critics; some who had
greeted him as an <i>enfant prodige</i>&mdash;Chiarini amongst others&mdash;rejected
him as a perverter of public morals, whilst others
hailed him as one bringing a current of fresh air and the impulse
of a new vitality into the somewhat prim, lifeless work hitherto
produced.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Review of Angelo Sommaruga perished in the
midst of scandal, and his group of young authors found itself
dispersed. Some entered the teaching career and were lost to
literature, others threw themselves into journalism. Gabriele
d&rsquo;Annunzio took this latter course, and joined the staff of the
<i>Tribuna</i>. For this paper, under the pseudonym of &ldquo;Duca
Minimo,&rdquo; he did some of his most brilliant work, and the articles
he wrote during that period of originality and exuberance would
well repay being collected. To this period of greater maturity and
deeper culture belongs <i>Il Libro d&rsquo; Isotta</i> (1886), a love poem, in
which for the first time he drew inspiration adapted to modern
sentiments and passions from the rich colours of the Renaissance.
<i>Il Libro d&rsquo; Isotta</i> is interesting also, because in it we find most
of the germs of his future work, just as in <i>Intermezzo melico</i> and
in certain ballads and sonnets we find descriptions and emotions
which later went to form the aesthetic contents of <i>Il Piacere</i>, <i>Il
Trionfo della Morte</i>, and <i>Elegie Romane</i> (1892).</p>

<p>D&rsquo; Annunzio&rsquo;s first novel <i>Il Piacere</i> (1889)&mdash;translated into
English as <i>The Child of Pleasure</i>&mdash;was followed in 1891 by
<i>L&rsquo; Innocente</i> (<i>The Intruder</i>), and in 1892 by <i>Giovanni Episcopo</i>.
These three novels created a profound impression. <i>L&rsquo; Innocente</i>,
admirably translated into French by Georges Herelle, brought
its author the notice and applause of foreign critics. His next
work, <i>Il Trionfo della Morte</i> (<i>The Triumph of Death</i>) (1894),
was followed at a short distance by <i>La Vergini della Roccio</i>
(1896) and <i>Il Fuoco</i> (1900), which in its descriptions of Venice
is perhaps the most ardent glorification of a city existing in any
language.</p>

<p>D&rsquo; Annunzio&rsquo;s poetic work of this period, in most respects
his finest, is represented by <i>Il Poema Paradisiaco</i> (1893), the
<i>Odi Navali</i> (1893), a superb attempt at civic poetry, and <i>Laudi</i>
(1900).</p>

<p>A later phase of d&rsquo; Annunzio&rsquo;s work is his dramatic production,
represented by <i>Il Sogno di un mattino di primavera</i> (1897), a
lyrical fantasia in one act; his <i>Cilia Morta</i> (1898), written for
Sarah Bernhardt, which is certainly among the most daring
and original of modern tragedies, and the only one which by its
unity, persistent purpose, and sense of fate seems to continue
in a measure the traditions of the Greek theatre. In 1898
he wrote his <i>Sogno di un Pomeriggio d&rsquo; Autunno</i> and <i>La
Gioconda</i>; in the succeeding year <i>La Gloria</i>, an attempt at
contemporary political tragedy which met with no success,
probably through the audacity of the personal and political
allusions in some of its scenes; and then <i>Francesca da Rimini</i>
(1901), a perfect reconstruction of medieval atmosphere
and emotion, magnificent in style, and declared by one of the
most authoritative Italian critics&mdash;Edoardo Boutet&mdash;to be the
first real although not perfect tragedy which has ever been given
to the Italian theatre.</p>

<p>The work of d&rsquo; Annunzio, although by many of the younger
generation injudiciously and extravagantly admired, is almost
the most important literary work given to Italy since the days
when the great classics welded her varying dialects into a fixed
language. The psychological inspiration of his novels has come
to him from many sources&mdash;French, Russian, Scandinavian,
German&mdash;and in much of his earlier work there is little
fundamental originality. His creative power is intense and
searching, but narrow and personal; his heroes and heroines are
little more than one same type monotonously facing a different
problem at a different phase of life. But the faultlessness of his
style and the wealth of his language have been approached by
none of his contemporaries, whom his genius has somewhat
paralysed. In his later work, when he begins drawing his inspiration
from the traditions of bygone Italy in her glorious centuries,
a current of real life seems to run through the veins of his
personages. And the lasting merit of d&rsquo;Annunzio, his real value
to the literature of his country, consists precisely in that he opened
up the closed mine of its former life as a source of inspiration
for the present and of hope for the future, and created a language,
neither pompous nor vulgar, drawn from every source and district
suited to the requirements of modern thought, yet absolutely
classical, borrowed from none, and, independently of the thought
it may be used to express, a thing of intrinsic beauty. As
his sight became clearer and his purpose strengthened, as exaggerations,
affectations, and moods dropped away from his conceptions,
his work became more and more typical Latin work,
upheld by the ideal of an Italian Renaissance.</p>

process employed ritually in all religions and among all races,
civilized or savage, partly as a mode of ridding persons and
things of dangerous influences and diseases, especially of the
demons (Persian <i>drug</i>, Greek <span class="grk" title="kêres">&#954;&#8134;&#961;&#949;&#962;</span>, Armenian <i>dev</i>) which are or
cause those diseases; and partly as a means of introducing into
things and persons a sacramental or divine influence, a holy
emanation, spirit or power. The riddance of an evil influence is
often synonymous with the introduction of the good principle,
and therefore it is best to consider first the use of anointing in
consecrations.</p>

<p>The Australian natives believed that the virtues of one killed
could be transferred to survivors if the latter rubbed themselves
with his caul-fat. So the Arabs of East Africa anoint themselves
with lion&rsquo;s fat in order to gain courage and inspire the animals
with awe of themselves. Such rites are often associated with the
actual eating of the victim whose virtues are coveted. Human
fat is a powerful charm all over the world; for, as R. Smith
points out, after the blood the fat was peculiarly the vehicle
and seat of life. This is why fat of a victim was smeared on a
sacred stone, not only in acts of homage paid to it, but in the
actual consecration thereof. In such cases the influence of the
god, communicated to the victim, passed with the unguent into
the stone. But the divinity could by anointing be transferred
into men no less than into stones; and from immemorial antiquity,
among the Jews as among other races, kings were
anointed or greased, doubtless with the fat of the victims which,
like the blood, was too holy to be eaten by the common votaries.</p>

<p>Butter made from the milk of the cow, the most sacred of
animals, is used for anointing in the Hindu religion. A newly-built
house is smeared with it, so are demoniacs, care being taken
to smear the latter downwards from head to foot.</p>

<p>In the Christian religion, especially where animal sacrifices,
together with the cult of totem or holy animals, have been given
up, it is usual to hallow the oil used in ritual anointings with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page80" id="page80"></a>80</span>
special prayers and exorcisms; oil from the lamps lit before the
altar has a peculiar virtue of its own, perhaps because it can be
burned to give light, and disappears to heaven in doing so. In
any case oil has ever been regarded as the aptest symbol and
vehicle of the holy and illuminating spirit. For this reason the
catechumens are anointed with holy oil both before and after
baptism; the one act (of eastern origin) assists the expulsion
of the evil spirits, the other (of western origin), taken in conjunction
with imposition of hands, conveys the spirit and
retains it in the person of the baptized. In the postbaptismal
anointing the oil was applied to the organs of sense, to the head,
heart, and midriff. Such ritual use of oil as a <span class="grk" title="sfragis">&#963;&#966;&#961;&#945;&#947;&#943;&#962;</span> or seal
may have been suggested in old religions by the practice of
keeping wine fresh in jars and amphorae by pouring on a top
layer of oil; for the spoiling of wine was attributed to the action
of demons of corruption, against whom many ancient formulae
of aversion or exorcism still exist.</p>

<p>The holy oil, chrism, or <span class="grk" title="muron">&#956;&#973;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span>, as the Easterns call it, was
prepared and consecrated on Maundy Thursday, and in the
Gelasian sacramentary the formula used runs thus: &ldquo;Send
forth, O Lord, we beseech thee, thy Holy Spirit the Paraclete
from heaven into this fatness of oil, which thou hast deigned to
bring forth out of the green wood for the refreshing of mind and
body; and through thy holy benediction may it be for all who
anoint with it, taste it, touch it, a safeguard of mind and body,
of soul and spirit, for the expulsion of all pains, of every infirmity,
of every sickness of mind and body. For with the same thou
hast anointed priests, kings, and prophets and martyrs with this
thy chrism, perfected by thee, O Lord, blessed, abiding within
our bowels in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In various churches the dead are anointed with holy oil, to
guard them against the vampires or ghouls which ever threaten
to take possession of dead bodies and live in them. In the
Armenian church, as formerly in many Greek churches, a cross
is not holy until the Spirit has been formally led into it by means
of prayer and anointing with holy oil. A new church is anointed
at its four corners, and also the altar round which it is built;
similarly tombs, church gongs, and all other instruments and
utensils dedicated to cultual uses. In churches of the Greek
rite a little of the old year&rsquo;s chrism is left in the jar to communicate
its sanctity to that of the new.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANOMALY<a name="ar51" id="ar51"></a></span> (from Gr. <span class="grk" title="anomalia">&#7936;&#957;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#955;&#943;&#945;</span>, unevenness, derived from
<span class="grk" title="an-">&#7936;&#957;-</span>, privative, and <span class="grk" title="homalos">&#8001;&#956;&#945;&#955;&#972;&#962;</span>, even), a deviation from the common
rule. In astronomy the word denotes the angular distance of a
body from the pericentre of the orbit in which it is moving.
Let AB be the major axis of the orbit, B the pericentre, F the
focus or centre of motion, P the position of the body. The
anomaly is then the angle BFP which the radius vector makes
with the major axis. This is the actual or <i>true anomaly</i>. <i>Mean
anomaly</i> is the anomaly which the
body would have if it moved from
the pericentre around F with a
uniform angular motion such that
its revolution would be completed
in its actual time (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Orbit</a></span>).
<i>Eccentric anomaly</i> is defined thus:&mdash;
Draw the circumscribing circle of
the elliptic orbit around the centre C
of the orbit. Drop the perpendicular
RPQ through P, the position of
the planet, upon the major axis.
Join CR; the angle CRQ is then the eccentric anomaly.</p>

<p>In the ancient astronomy the anomaly was taken as the
angular distance of the planet from the point of the farthest
recession from the earth.</p>

<p><i>Kepler&rsquo;s Problem</i>, namely, that of finding the co-ordinates of a
planet at a given time, which is equivalent&mdash;given the mean
anomaly&mdash;to that of determining the true anomaly, was solved
approximately by Kepler, and more completely by Wallis,
Newton and others.</p>

<p>The anomalistic revolution of a planet or other heavenly body
is the revolution between two consecutive passages through the
pericentre. Starting from the pericentre, it is completed on the
return to the pericentre. If the pericentre is fixed, this is an
actual revolution; but if it moves the anomalistic revolution
is greater or less than a complete circumference.</p>

<p>An <i>Anomalistic year</i> is the time (365 days, 6 hours, 13 minutes,
48 seconds) in which the earth (and similarly for any other
planet) passes from perihelion to perihelion, or from any given
value of the anomaly to the same again. Owing to the precession
of the equinoxes it is longer than a tropical or sidereal year by
25 minutes and 2.3 seconds. An <i>Anomalistic month</i> is the time
in which the moon passes from perigee to perigee, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Anorthite is an essential constituent
of many basic igneous
rocks, such as gabbro and basalt,
also of some meteoric stones. The
best developed crystals are those
which accompany mica, augite,
sanidine, &amp;c., in the ejected blocks
of metamorphosed limestone from
Monte Somma, the ancient portion
of Mount Vesuvius; these are
perfectly colourless and transparent, and are bounded by
numerous brilliant faces. Distinctly developed crystals are
also met with in the basalts of Japan, but are usually rare at
other localities.</p>

<p>The name anorthite was given to the Vesuvian mineral by
G. Rose in 1823, on account of its anorthic crystallization. The
species had, however, been earlier described by the comte de
Bournon under the name indianite, this name being applied to a
greyish or reddish granular mineral forming the matrix of corundum
from the Carnatic in India. Several unimportant varieties
have been distinguished.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANQUETIL, LOUIS PIERRE<a name="ar53" id="ar53"></a></span> (1723-1808), French historian,
was born in Paris, on the 21st of February 1723. He entered the
congregation of Sainte-Geneviève, where he took holy orders and
became professor of theology and literature. Later, he became
director of the seminary at Reims, where he wrote his <i>Histoire
civile et politique de Reims</i> (3 vols., 1756-1757), perhaps his best
work. He was then director of the college of Senlis, where he
composed his <i>Esprit de la Ligue ou histoire politique des troubles
de la Fronde pendant le XVI<span class="sp">e</span> et le XVII<span class="sp">e</span> siècles</i> (1767). During
the Reign of Terror he was imprisoned at St Lazare; there he
began his <i>Précis de l&rsquo;histoire universelle</i>, afterwards published in
nine volumes. On the establishment of the national institute he
was elected a member of the second group (moral and political
sciences), and was soon afterwards employed in the office of the
ministry of foreign affairs, profiting by his experience to write his
<i>Motifs des guerres et des traités de paix sous Louis XIV., Louis XV,
et Louis XVI.</i> He is said to have been asked by Napoleon to
write his <i>Histoire de France</i> (14 vols., 1805), a mediocre compilation
at second or third hand, with the assistance of de Mézeray
and of Paul François Velly (1709-1759). This work, nevertheless,
passed through numerous editions, and by it his name is remembered.
He died on the 6th of September 1808.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANQUETIL, DUPERRON, ABRAHAM HYACINTHE<a name="ar54" id="ar54"></a></span> (1731-1805),
French orientalist, brother of Louis Pierre Anquetil, the
historian, was born in Paris on the 7th of December 1731. He
was educated for the priesthood in Paris and Utrecht, but his taste
for Hebrew, Arabic, Persian, and other languages of the East
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>81</span>
developed into a passion, and he discontinued his theological
course to devote himself entirely to them. His diligent attendance
at the Royal Library attracted the attention of the keeper
of the manuscripts, the Abbé Sallier, whose influence procured
for him a small salary as student of the oriental languages. He
had lighted on some fragments of the <i>Vendidad Sade</i>, and formed
the project of a voyage to India to discover the works of Zoroaster.
With this end in view he enlisted as a private soldier, on the 2nd
of November 1754, in the Indian expedition which was about to
start from the port of L&rsquo;Orient. His friends procured his discharge,
and he was granted a free passage, a seat at the captain&rsquo;s
table, and a salary, the amount of which was to be fixed by the
governor of the French settlement in India. After a passage of
six months, Anquetil landed, on the 10th of August 1755, at
Pondicherry. Here he remained a short time to master modern
Persian, and then hastened to Chandernagore to acquire Sanskrit.
Just then war was declared between France and England;
Chandernagore was taken, and Anquetil returned to Pondicherry
by land. He found one of his brothers at Pondicherry, and
embarked with him for Surat; but, with a view of exploring the
country, he landed at Mahé and proceeded on foot. At Surat he
succeeded, by perseverance and address in his intercourse with
the native priests, in acquiring a sufficient knowledge of the Zend
and Pahlavi languages to translate the liturgy called the <i>Vendidad
Sade</i> and some other works. Thence he proposed going to
Benares, to study the language, antiquities, and sacred laws of
the Hindus; but the capture of Pondicherry obliged him to quit
India. Returning to Europe in an English vessel, he spent some
time in London and Oxford, and then set out for France. He
arrived in Paris on the 14th of March 1762 in possession of one
hundred and eighty oriental manuscripts, besides other curiosities.
The Abbé Barthélemy procured for him a pension, with the
appointment of interpreter of oriental languages at the Royal
Library. In 1763 he was elected an associate of the Academy of
Inscriptions, and began to arrange for the publication of the
materials he had collected during his eastern travels. In 1771 he
published his <i>Zend-Avesta</i> (3 vols.), containing collections from
the sacred writings of the fire-worshippers, a life of Zoroaster, and
fragments of works ascribed to him. In 1778 he published at
Amsterdam his <i>Législation orientate</i>, in which he endeavoured to
prove that the nature of oriental despotism had been greatly
misrepresented. His <i>Recherches historiques et géographiques sur
l&rsquo;Inde</i> appeared in 1786, and formed part of Thieffenthaler&rsquo;s
<i>Geography of India</i>. The Revolution seems to have greatly
affected him. During that period he abandoned society, and
lived in voluntary poverty on a few pence a day. In 1798 he
published <i>L&rsquo;Inde en rapport avec l&rsquo;Europe</i> (Hamburg, 2 vols.),
which contained much invective against the English, and numerous
misrepresentations. In 1802-1804 he published a Latin translation
(2 vols.) from the Persian of the <i>Oupnek&rsquo;hat</i> or <i>Upanishada</i>.
It is a curious mixture of Latin, Greek, Persian, Arabic, and
Sanskrit. He died in Paris on the 17th of January 1805.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANSELM<a name="ar58" id="ar58"></a></span> (<i>c</i>. 1033-1109), archbishop of Canterbury, was born
at Aosta in Piedmont. His family was accounted noble, and
was possessed of considerable property. Gundulph, his father,
was by birth a Lombard, and seems to have been a man of harsh
and violent temper; his mother, Ermenberga, was a prudent and
virtuous woman, from whose careful religious training the young
Anselm derived much benefit. At the age of fifteen he desired
to enter a convent, but he could not obtain his father&rsquo;s consent.
Disappointment brought on an illness, on his recovery from
which he seems for a time to have given up his studies, and to
have plunged into the gay life of the world. During this time his
mother died, and his father&rsquo;s harshness became unbearable.
He left home, and with only one attendant crossed the Alps,
and wandered through Burgundy and France. Attracted by
the fame of his countryman, Lanfranc, then prior of Bec, he
entered Normandy, and, after spending some time at Avranches,
settled at the monastery of Bec. There, at the age of twenty-seven,
he became a monk; three years later, when Lanfranc
was promoted to the abbacy of Caen, he was elected prior.
This office he held for fifteen years, and then, in 1078, on the
death of Herlwin, the warrior monk who had founded the
monastery, he was made abbot. Under his rule Bec became the
first seat of learning in Europe, a result due not more to his
intellectual powers than to the great moral influence of his
noble character and kindly discipline. It was during these quiet
years at Bec that Anselm wrote his first philosophical and religious
works, the dialogues on Truth and Freewill, and the two
celebrated treatises, the <i>Monologion</i> and <i>Proslogion</i>.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the convent had been growing in wealth, as well
as in reputation, and had acquired considerable property in
England, which it became the duty of Anselm occasionally to
visit. By his mildness of temper and unswerving rectitude,
he so endeared himself to the English that he was looked upon
and desired as the natural successor to Lanfranc, then archbishop
of Canterbury. But on the death of that great man, the ruling
sovereign, William Rufus, seized the possessions and revenues
of the see, and made no new appointment. About four years
after, in 1092, on the invitation of Hugh, earl of Chester, Anselm
with some reluctance, for he feared to be made archbishop,
crossed to England. He was detained by business for nearly
four months, and when about to return, was refused permission
by the king. In the following year William fell ill, and thought
his death was at hand. Eager to make atonement for his sin
with regard to the archbishopric, he nominated Anselm to the
vacant see, and after a great struggle compelled him to accept
the pastoral staff of office. After obtaining dispensation from
his duties in Normandy, Anselm was consecrated in 1093. He
demanded of the king, as the conditions of his retaining office,
that he should give up all the possessions of the see, accept his
spiritual counsel, and acknowledge Urban as pope in opposition
to the anti-pope, Clement. He only obtained a partial consent
to the first of these, and the last involved him in a serious difficulty
with the king. It was a rule of the church that the consecration
of metropolitans could not be completed without their receiving
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page82" id="page82"></a>82</span>
the <i>pallium</i> from the hands of the pope. Anselm, accordingly,
insisted that he must proceed to Rome to receive the pall. But
William would not permit this; he had not acknowledged Urban,
and he maintained his right to prevent any pope being acknowledged
by an English subject without his permission. A great
council of churchmen and nobles, held to settle the matter,
advised Anselm to submit to the king, but failed to overcome
his mild and patient firmness. The matter was postponed,
and William meanwhile privately sent messengers to Rome,
who acknowledged Urban and prevailed on him to send a legate
to the king bearing the archiepiscopal pall. A partial reconciliation
was then effected, and the matter of the pall was compromised.
It was not given by the king, but was laid on the
altar at Canterbury, whence Anselm took it.</p>

<p>Little more than a year after, fresh trouble arose with the king,
and Anselm resolved to proceed to Rome and seek the counsel
of his spiritual father. With great difficulty he obtained a
reluctant permission to leave, and in October 1097 he set out
for Rome. William immediately seized on the revenues of the
see, and retained them to his death. Anselm was received with
high honour by Urban, and at a great council held at Bari, he
was put forward to defend the doctrine of the procession of the
Holy Ghost against the representatives of the Greek Church.
But Urban was too politic to embroil himself with the king of
England, and Anselm found that he could obtain no substantial
result. He withdrew from Rome, and spent some time at the
little village of Schiavi, where he finished his treatise on the
atonement, <i>Cur Deus homo</i>, and then retired to Lyons.</p>

<p>In 1100 William was killed, and Henry, his successor, at once
recalled Anselm. But Henry demanded that he should again
receive from him in person investiture in his office of archbishop,
thus making the dignity entirely dependent on the royal
authority. Now, the papal rule in the matter was plain; all
homage and lay investiture were strictly prohibited. Anselm
represented this to the king; but Henry would not relinquish
a privilege possessed by his predecessors, and proposed that the
matter should be laid before the Holy See. The answer of the
pope reaffirmed the law as to investiture. A second embassy
was sent, with a similar result. Henry, however, remained
firm, and at last, in 1103, Anselm and an envoy from the king
set out for Rome. The pope, Paschal, reaffirmed strongly the
rule of investiture, and passed sentence of excommunication
against all who had infringed the law, except Henry. Practically
this left matters as they were, and Anselm, who had received
a message forbidding him to return to England unless on the
king&rsquo;s terms, withdrew to Lyons, where he waited to see if
Paschal would not take stronger measures. At last, in 1105,
he resolved himself to excommunicate Henry. His intention
was made known to the king through his sister, and it seriously
alarmed him, for it was a critical period in his affairs. A meeting
was arranged, and a reconciliation between them effected. In
1106 Anselm crossed to England, with power from the pope
to remove the sentence of excommunication from the illegally
invested churchmen. In 1107 the long dispute as to investiture
was finally ended by the king resigning his formal rights. The
remaining two years of Anselm&rsquo;s life were spent in the duties
of his archbishopric. He died on the 21st of April 1109. He
was canonized in 1494 by Alexander VI.</p>

<p>Anselm may, with some justice, be considered the first scholastic
philosopher and theologian. His only great predecessor,
Scotus Erigena, had more of the speculative and mystical
element than is consistent with a schoolman; but in Anselm
are found that recognition of the relation of reason to revealed
truth, and that attempt to elaborate a rational system of faith,
which form the special characteristics of scholastic thought.
His constant endeavour is to render the contents of the Christian
consciousness clear to reason, and to develop the intelligible
truths interwoven with the Christian belief. The necessary
preliminary for this is the possession of the Christian consciousness.
&ldquo;He who does not believe will not experience; and he
who has not experienced will not understand.&rdquo; That faith must
precede knowledge is reiterated by him. <i>&rdquo;Negue enim quaero
intelligere ut credam, sed credo ut intelligam. Nam et hoc credo,
quia, nisi credidero, non intelligam.&rdquo;</i> (&ldquo;Nor do I seek to understand
that I may believe, but I believe that I may understand.
For this too I believe, that unless I first believe, I shall not understand.&rdquo;)
But after the faith is held fast, the attempt must be
made to demonstrate by reason the truth of what we believe.
It is wrong not to do so. <i>&rdquo;Negligentiae mihi esse videtur, si,
postquam confirmati sumus in fide, non studemus quod credimus,
intelligere.&rdquo;</i> (&ldquo;I hold it to be a failure in duty if after we have
become steadfast in the faith we do not strive to understand
what we believe.&rdquo;) To such an extent does he carry this demand
for rational explanation that, at times, it seems as if he claimed
for unassisted intelligence the power of penetrating even to the
mysteries of the Christian faith. On the whole, however, the
qualified statement is his real view; merely rational proofs are
always, he affirms, to be tested by Scripture. (<i>Cur Deus homo</i>,
i. 2 and 38; <i>De Fide Trin</i>. 2.)</p>

<p>The groundwork of his theory of knowledge is contained in
the tract <i>De Veritate</i>, in which, from the consideration of truth
as in knowledge, in willing, and in things, he rises to the affirmation
of an absolute truth, in which all other truth participates.
This absolute truth is God himself, who is therefore the ultimate
ground or principle both of things and of thought. The notion
of God comes thus into the foreground of the system; before
all things it is necessary that it should be made clear to reason,
that it should be demonstrated to have real existence. This
demonstration is the substance of the <i>Monologion</i> and <i>Proslogion</i>.
In the first of these the proof rests on the ordinary grounds of
realism, and coincides to some extent with the earlier theory of
Augustine, though it is carried out with singular boldness and
fulness. Things, he says, are called good in a variety of ways
and degrees; this would be impossible if there were not some
absolute standard, some good in itself, in which all relative
goods participate. Similarly with such predicates as great,
just; they involve a certain greatness and justice. The very
existence of things is impossible without some one Being, by
whom they are. This absolute Being, this goodness, justice,
greatness, is God. Anselm was not thoroughly satisfied with
this reasoning; it started from <i>a posteriori grounds</i>, and contained
several converging lines of proof. He desired to have
some one short demonstration. Such a demonstration he
presented in the <i>Proslogion</i>; it is his celebrated ontological
proof. God is that being than whom none greater can be
conceived. Now, if that than which nothing greater can be
conceived existed only in the intellect, it would not be the
absolutely greatest, for we could add to it existence in reality.
It follows, then, that the being than whom nothing greater can
be conceived, <i>i.e.</i> God, necessarily has real existence. This
reasoning, in which Anselm partially anticipated the Cartesian
philosophers, has rarely seemed satisfactory. It was opposed
at the time by the monk Gaunilo, in his <i>Liber pro Insipiente</i>, on
the ground that we cannot pass from idea to reality. The same
criticism is made by several of the later schoolmen, among others
by Aquinas, and is in substance what Kant advances against all
ontological proof. Anselm replied to the objections of Gaunilo in
his <i>Liber Apologeticus</i>. The existence of God being thus held
proved, he proceeds to state the rational grounds of the Christian
doctrines of creation and of the Trinity. With reference to this
last, he says we cannot know God from himself, but only after
the analogy of his creatures; and the special analogy used is
the self-consciousness of man, its peculiar double nature, with
the necessary elements, memory and intelligence, representing
the relation of the Father to the Son. The mutual love of these
two, proceeding from the relation they hold to one another,
symbolizes the Holy Spirit. The further theological doctrines of
man, original sin, free will, are developed, partly in the <i>Monologion</i>,
partly in other mixed treatises. Finally, in his greatest
work, <i>Cur Deus homo</i>, he undertakes to make plain, even to
infidels, the rational necessity of the Christian mystery of the
atonement. The theory rests on three positions: that satisfaction
is necessary on account of God&rsquo;s honour and justice; that
such satisfaction can be given only by the peculiar personality
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>83</span>
of the God-man; that such satisfaction is really given by the
voluntary death of this infinitely valuable person. The demonstration
is, in brief, this. All the actions of men are due to the
furtherance of God&rsquo;s glory; if, then, there be sin, <i>i.e.</i> if God&rsquo;s
honour be wounded, man of himself can give no satisfaction.
But the justice of God demands satisfaction; and as an insult
to infinite honour is in itself infinite, the satisfaction must be
infinite, <i>i.e.</i> it must outweigh all that is not God. Such a penalty
can only be paid by God himself, and, as a penalty for man,
must be paid under the form of man. Satisfaction is only possible
through the God-man. Now this God-man, as sinless, is exempt
from the punishment of sin; His passion is therefore voluntary,
not given as due. The merit of it is therefore infinite; God&rsquo;s
justice is thus appeased, and His mercy may extend to man.
This theory has exercised immense influence on the form of
church doctrine. It is certainly an advance on the older patristic
theory, in so far as it substitutes for a contest between God and
Satan, a contest between the goodness and justice of God; but
it puts the whole relation on a merely legal footing, gives it no
ethical bearing, and neglects altogether the consciousness of the
individual to be redeemed. In this respect it contrasts unfavourably
with the later theory of Abelard.</p>

<p>Anselm&rsquo;s speculations did not receive, in the middle ages,
the respect and attention justly their due. This was probably
due to their unsystematic character, for they are generally tracts
or dialogues on detached questions, not elaborate treatises like
the great works of Albert, Aquinas, and Erigena. They have,
however, a freshness and philosophical vigour, which more than
makes up for their want of system, and which raises them far
above the level of most scholastic writings.</p>

very humble parents at Laon before the middle of the 11th
century. He is said to have studied under St Anselm at Bec.
About 1076 he taught with great success at Paris, where, as the
associate of William of Champeaux, he upheld the realistic side
of the scholastic controversy. Later he removed to his native
place, where his school for theology and exegetics rapidly became
the most famous in Europe. He died in 1117. His greatest
work, an interlinear gloss on the Scriptures, was one of the
great authorities of the middle ages. It has been frequently
reprinted. Other commentaries apparently by him have been
ascribed to various writers, principally to the great Anselm. A
list of them, with notice of Anselm&rsquo;s life, is contained in the

<p><span class="bold">ANSELME<a name="ar60" id="ar60"></a></span> (Father Anselme of the Virgin Mary) (1625-1694),
French genealogist, was born in Paris in 1625. As a layman his
name was Pierre Guibours. He entered the order of the barefooted
Augustinians on the 31st of March 1644, and it was in
their monastery (called the Couvent des Petits Pères, near the
church of Notre-Dame des Victoires) that he died, on the 17th
of January 1694. He devoted his entire life to genealogical
studies. In 1663 he published <i>Le Palais de l&rsquo;honneur</i>, which
besides giving the genealogy of the houses of Lorraine and Savoy,
is a complete treatise on heraldry, and in 1664 <i>Le Palais de la
gloire</i>, dealing with the genealogy of various illustrious French
and European families. These books made friends for him, the
most intimate among whom, Honoré Caille, seigneur du Fourny
(1630-1713), persuaded him to publish his <i>Histoire généalogique
de la maison royale de France, et des grands officiers de
la couronne</i> (1674, 2 vols. 4); after Father Anselme&rsquo;s death,
Honoré Caille collected his papers, and brought out a new edition
of this highly important work in 1712. The task was taken up
and continued by two other friars of the Couvent des Petits
Pères, Father Ange de Sainte-Rosalie (François Raffard, 1655-1726),
and Father Simplicien (Paul Lucas, 1683-1759), who
published the first and second volumes of the third edition in
1726. This edition consists of nine volumes folio; it is a genealogical
and chronological history of the royal house of France,
of the peers, of the great officers of the crown and of the king&rsquo;s
household, and of the ancient barons of the kingdom. The notes
were generally compiled from original documents, references
to which are usually given, so that they remain useful to the

<p><span class="bold">ANSON, GEORGE ANSON,<a name="ar61" id="ar61"></a></span> <span class="sc">Baron</span> (1697-1762), British admiral,
was born on the 23rd of April 1697. He was the son of
William Anson of Shugborough in Staffordshire, and his wife
Isabella Carrier, who was the sister-in-law of Lord Chancellor
Macclesfield, a relationship which proved very useful to the
future admiral. George Anson entered the navy in February
1712, and by rapid steps became lieutenant in 1716, commander
in 1722, and post-captain in 1724. In this rank he served twice
on the North American station as captain of the &ldquo;Scarborough&rdquo;
and the &ldquo;Squirrel&rdquo; from 1724 to 1730 and from 1733 to 1735.
In 1737 he was appointed to the &ldquo;Centurion,&rdquo; 60, on the eve of
war with Spain, and when hostilities had begun he was chosen
to command as commodore the squadron which was sent to attack
her possessions in South America in 1740. The original scheme
was ambitious, and was not carried out. Anson&rsquo;s squadron,
which sailed later than had been intended, and was very ill-fitted,
consisted of six ships, which were reduced by successive disasters
to his flagship the &ldquo;Centurion.&rdquo; The lateness of the season
forced him to round Cape Horn in very stormy weather, and the
navigating instruments of the time did not allow of exact observation.
Two of his vessels failed to round the Horn, another, the
&ldquo;Wager,&rdquo; was wrecked in the Golfo de Pañas on the coast of
Chile. By the time Anson reached the island of Juan Fernandez
in June 1741, his six ships had been reduced to three, while the
strength of his crews had fallen from 961 to 335. In the absence
of any effective Spanish force on the coast he was able to harass
the enemy, and to capture the town of Paita on the 13th-15th
of November 1741. The steady diminution of his crew by sickness,
and the worn-out state of his remaining consorts, compelled
him at last to collect all the survivors in the &ldquo;Centurion.&rdquo; He
rested at the island of Tinian, and then made his way to Macao
in November 1742. After considerable difficulties with the
Chinese, he sailed again with his one remaining vessel to cruise
for one of the richly laden galleons which conducted the trade
between Mexico and the Philippines. The indomitable perseverance
he had shown during one of the most arduous voyages
in the history of sea adventure was rewarded by the capture of
an immensely rich prize, the &ldquo;Nuestra Señora de Covadonga,&rdquo;
which was met off Cape Espiritu Santo on the 20th of June 1743.
Anson took his prize back to Macao, sold her cargo to the Chinese,
keeping the specie, and sailed for England, which he reached by
the Cape of Good Hope on the 15th of June 1744. The prize-money
earned by the capture of the galleon had made him a rich
man for life, and under the influence of irritation caused by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>84</span>
refusal of the admiralty to confirm a captain&rsquo;s commission he
had given to one of his officers, Anson refused the rank of rear-admiral,
and was prepared to leave the service. His fame would
stand nearly as high as it does if he had done so, but he would be
a far less important figure in the history of the navy. By the
world at large he is known as the commander of the voyage of
circumnavigation, in which success was won by indomitable
perseverance, unshaken firmness, and infinite resource. But he
was also the severe and capable administrator who during years
of hard work at the admiralty did more than any other to raise
the navy from the state of corruption and indiscipline into
which it had fallen during the first half of the eighteenth century.
Great anger had been caused in the country by the condition of
the fleet as revealed in the first part of the war with France and
Spain, between 1739 and 1747. The need for reform was strongly
felt, and the politicians of the day were conscious that it would
not be safe to neglect the popular demand for it. In 1745 the
duke of Bedford, the new first lord, invited Anson to join the
admiralty with the rank of rear-admiral of the white. As
subordinate under the duke, or Lord Sandwich, and as first lord
himself, Anson was at the admiralty with one short break from
1745 till his death in 1762. His chiefs in the earlier years left
him to take the initiative in all measures of reform, and supported
him in their own interest. After 1751 he was himself first lord,
except for a short time in 1756 and 1757. At his suggestion, or
with his advice, the naval administration was thoroughly overhauled.
The dockyards were brought into far better order, and
though corruption was not banished, it was much reduced. The
navy board was compelled to render accounts, a duty it had long
neglected. A system of regulating promotion to flag rank, which
has been in the main followed ever since, was introduced. The
Navy Discipline Act was revised in 1749, and remained unaltered
till 1865. Courts martial were put on a sound footing. Inspections
of the fleet and the dockyards were established, and the
corps of Marines was created in 1755. The progressive improvement
which raised the navy to the high state of efficiency it
attained in later years dates from Anson&rsquo;s presence at the
admiralty. In 1747 he, without ceasing to be a member of the
board, commanded the Channel fleet which on the 3rd of May
scattered a large French convoy bound to the East, and West
Indies, in an action off Cape Finisterre. Several men-of-war
and armed French Indiamen were taken, but the overwhelming
superiority of Anson&rsquo;s fleet (fourteen men-of-war, to six men-of-war
and four Indiamen) in the number and weight of ships
deprives the action of any strong claim to be considered remarkable.
In society Anson seems to have been cold and taciturn.
The sneers of Horace Walpole, and the savage attack of Smollett
in <i>The Adventures of an Atom</i>, are animated by personal or
political spite. Yet they would not have accused him of defects
from which he was notoriously free. In political life he may
sometimes have given too ready assent to the wishes of powerful
politicians. He married the daughter of Lord Chancellor
Hardwicke on the 27th of April 1748. There were no children of
the marriage. His title of Baron Anson of Soberton was given
him in 1747, but became extinct on his death. The title of
Viscount Anson was, however, created in 1806 in favour of his
great-nephew, the grandson of his sister Janetta and Mr Sambrook
Adams, whose father had assumed the name and arms of
Anson. The earldom of Lichfield was conferred on the family
in the next generation. A fine portrait of the admiral by
Reynolds is in the possession of the earl of Lichfield, and there
are copies in the National Portrait Gallery and at Greenwich.
Anson&rsquo;s promotions in flag rank were: rear-admiral in 1745,
vice-admiral in 1746, and admiral in 1748. In 1749 he became
vice-admiral of Great Britain, and in 1761 admiral of the fleet.
He died on the 6th of June 1762.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>A life of Lord Anson, inaccurate in some details but valuable and
interesting, was published by Sir John Barrow in 1839. The
standard account of his voyage round the world is that by his
chaplain Richard Walter, 1748, often reprinted. A share in the
work has been claimed on dubious grounds for Benjamin Robins,
the mathematician. Another and much inferior account was
published in 1745 by Pascoe Thomas, the schoolmaster of the
&ldquo;Centurion.&rdquo;</p>

Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, he took a first class in the final
classical schools in 1866, and was elected to a fellowship of All
Souls in the following year. In 1869 he was called to the bar,
and went the home circuit until 1873, when he succeeded to the
baronetcy. In 1874 he became Vinerian reader in English
law at Oxford, a post which he held until he became, in 1881,
warden of All Souls College. He identified himself both with
local and university interests; he became an alderman of the
city of Oxford in 1892, chairman of quarter sessions for the county
in 1894, was vice-chancellor of the university in 1898-1899,
and chancellor of the diocese of Oxford in 1899. In that year
he was returned, without opposition, as M.P. for the university
in the Liberal Unionist interest, and consequently resigned the
vice-chancellorship. In parliament he preserved an active
interest in education, being a member of the newly created
consultative committee of the Board of Education in 1900,
and in 1902 he became parliamentary secretary. He took an
active part in the foundation of a school of law at Oxford,

King&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, where he distinguished himself for
his Latin verses. He became a fellow of his college (1745); but
the degree of M.A. was withheld from him, owing to the offence

estates and left Cambridge; and two years later he married
the daughter of Felix Calvert of Albury Hall, Herts. For some
time Anstey published nothing of any note, though he cultivated
letters as well as his estates. Some visits to Bath, however,
where later, in 1770, he made his permanent home, resulted in
1766 in his famous rhymed letters, <i>The New Bath Guide</i> or
<i>Memoirs of the B ... r ... d</i> [<i>Blunderhead</i>] <i>Family</i> ...,
which had immediate success, and was enthusiastically praised
for its original kind of humour by Walpole and Gray. The

<p><span class="bold">ANSTRUTHER<a name="ar66" id="ar66"></a></span> (locally pronounced <i>Anster</i>), a seaport of Fifeshire,
Scotland. It comprises the royal and police burghs of
Anstruther Easter (pop. 1190), Anstruther Wester (501) and
Kilrenny (2542), and lies 9 m. S.S.E. of St Andrews, having a
station on the North British railway company&rsquo;s branch line from
Thornton Junction to St Andrews. The chief industries include
coast and deep-sea fisheries, shipbuilding, tanning, the making
of cod-liver oil and fish-curing. The harbour was completed in
1877 at a cost of £80,000. The two Anstruthers are divided
only by a small stream called Dreel Burn. James Melville
(1556-1614), nephew of the more celebrated reformer, Andrew
Melville, who was minister of Kilrenny, has given in his <i>Diary</i>
a graphic account of the arrival at Anstruther of a weatherbound
ship of the Armada, and the tradition of the intermixture
of Spanish and Fifeshire blood still prevails in the district.
Anstruther fair supplied William Tennant (1784-1848), who
was born and buried in the town, with the subject of his poem
of &ldquo;Anster Fair.&rdquo; Sir James Lumsden, a soldier of fortune
under Gustavus Adolphus, who distinguished himself in the
Thirty Years&rsquo; War, was born in the parish of Kilrenny about
1598. David Martin (1737-1798), the painter and engraver;
Thomas Chalmers (1780-1847), the great divine; and John
Goodsir (1814-1867), the anatomist, were natives of Anstruther.
Little more than a mile to the west lies the royal and police
burgh of Pittenweem (Gaelic, &ldquo;the hollow of the cave&rdquo;), a
quaint old fishing town (pop. 1863), with the remains of a priory.
About 2 m. still farther westwards is the fishing town of St
Monans or Abercromby (pop. 1898), with a fine old Gothic church,
picturesquely perched on the rocky shore. These fisher towns
on the eastern and south-eastern coasts of Fifeshire furnish
artists with endless subjects. Archibald Constable (1774-1827),
Sir Walter Scott&rsquo;s publisher, was born in the parish of Carnbee,
about 3 m. to the north of Pittenweem. The two Anstruthers,

<p><span class="bold">ANT<a name="ar68" id="ar68"></a></span> (O. Eng. <i>aémete</i>, from Teutonic <i>a</i>, privative, and <i>maitan</i>,
cut or bite off, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;the biter off&rdquo;; <i>aémete</i> in Middle English
became differentiated in dialect use to <i>amete</i>, then <i>amte</i>, and so
<i>ant</i>, and also to <i>emete</i>, whence the synonym &ldquo;emmet,&rdquo; now only
used provincially, &ldquo;ant&rdquo; being the general literary form). The
fact that the name of the ant has come down in English from a
thousand years ago shows that this class of insects impressed the
old inhabitants of England as they impressed the Hebrews and
Greeks. The social instincts and industrious habits of ants have
always made them favourite objects of study, and a vast amount
of literature has accumulated on the subject of their structure and
their modes of life.</p>

<p><i>Characters.</i>&mdash;An ant is easily recognized both by the casual
observer and by the student of insects. Ants form a distinct and
natural family (<i>Formicidae</i>) of the great order <i>Hymenoptera</i>, to
which bees, wasps and sawflies also belong. The insects of this
order have mandibles adapted for biting, and two pairs of membranous
wings are usually present; the first abdominal segment
(propodeum) becomes closely associated with the fore-body
(thorax), of which it appears to form a part. In all ants the second
(apparently the first) abdominal segment is very markedly
constricted at its front and hind edges, so that it forms a &ldquo;node&rdquo;
at the base of the hind-body (fig. 1), and in many ants the third
abdominal segment is similarly &ldquo;nodular&rdquo; in form (fig. 3, <i>b, c</i>).
It is this peculiar &ldquo;waist&rdquo; that catches the eye of the observer,
and makes the insects so easy of recognition. Another conspicuous
and well-known feature of ants is the wingless condition
of the &ldquo;workers,&rdquo; as the specialized females, with undeveloped
ovaries, which form the largest proportion of the population of
ant-communities, are called. Such &ldquo;workers&rdquo; are essential to
the formation of a social community of Hymenoptera, and their
wingless condition among the ants shows that their specialization
has been carried further in this family than among the wasps and
bees. Further, while among wasps and bees we find some solitary
and some social genera, the ants as a family are social, though some
aberrant species are dependent on the workers of other ants. It
is interesting and suggestive that in a few families of digging
Hymenoptera (such as the <i>Mutillidae</i>), allied to the ants, the
females are wingless. The perfect female or &ldquo;queen&rdquo; ants (figs.
1, <i>1</i>, 3, <i>a</i>) often cast their wings (fig. 3, <i>b</i>) after the nuptial flight;
in a few species the females, and in still fewer the males, never
develop wings. (For the so-called &ldquo;white ants,&rdquo; which belong to
an order far removed from the <i>Hymenoptera</i>, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Termite</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Structure.</i>&mdash;The head of an ant carries a pair of elbowed feelers,
each consisting of a minute basal and an elongate second segment,
forming the stalk or &ldquo;scape,&rdquo; while from eight to eleven short
segments make up the terminal &ldquo;flagellum.&rdquo; These segments
are abundantly supplied with elongate tooth-like projections
connected with nerve-endings probably olfactory in function.
The brain is well developed and its &ldquo;mushroom-bodies&rdquo; are
exceptionally large. The mandibles, which are frequently used
for carrying various objects, are situated well to the outside of
the maxillae, so that they can be opened and shut without
interfering with the latter. The peculiar form and arrangement
of the anterior abdominal segments have already been described.
The fourth abdominal segment is often very large, and forms
the greater part of the hind-body; this segment is markedly
constricted at its basal (forward) end, where it is embraced by the
small third segment. In many of those ants whose third abdominal
segment forms a second &ldquo;node,&rdquo; the basal dorsal region of
the fourth segment is traversed by a large number of very fine
transverse striations; over these the sharp hinder edge of the
third segment can be scraped to and fro, and the result is a
stridulating organ which gives rise to a note of very high pitch.
For the appreciation of the sounds made by these stridulators,
the ants are furnished with delicate organs of hearing (chordotonal
organs) in the head, in the three thoracic and two of the abdominal
segments and in the shins of the legs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page86" id="page86"></a>86</span></p>

<p>The hinder abdominal segments and the stings of the queens
and workers resemble those of other stinging Hymenoptera. But
there are several subfamilies of ants whose females have the
lancets of the sting useless for piercing, although the poison-glands
are functional, their secretion being ejected by the insect, when
occasion may arise, from the greatly enlarged reservoir, the
reduced sting acting as a squirt.</p>

<p><i>Nests.</i>&mdash;The nests of different kinds of ants are constructed in
very different situations; many species (<i>Lasius</i>, for example)
make underground nests; galleries and chambers being hollowed
out in the soil, and opening by small holes on the surface, or
protected above by a large stone. The wood ant (<i>Formica rufa</i>,
fig. 1) piles up a heap of leaves, twigs and other vegetable refuse,
so arranged as to form an orderly series of galleries, though the
structure appears at first sight a chaotic heap. Species of
<i>Camponotus</i> and many other ants tunnel in wood. In tropical
countries ants sometimes make their nests in the hollow thorns
of trees or on leaves; species with this habit are believed to make
a return to the tree for the shelter that it affords by protecting it
from the ravages of other insects, including their own leaf-cutting
relations.</p>

<p><i>Early Stages.</i>&mdash;The larvae of ants (fig. 3, <i>e</i>) are legless and
helpless maggots with very small heads (fig. 3, <i>f</i>), into whose
mouths the requisite food has to be forced by the assiduous
&ldquo;nurse&rdquo; workers. The maggots are tended by these nurses with the
greatest care, and carried to those parts of the nest most favourable
for their health and growth. When fully grown, the maggot
spins an oval silken cocoon within which it pupates (fig. 3, <i>g</i>).
These cocoons, which may often be seen carried between the
mandibles of the workers, are the &ldquo;ants&rsquo; eggs&rdquo; prized as food for
fish and pheasants. The workers of a Ceylonese ant (<i>Oecophylla
smaragdina</i>) are stated by D. Sharp to hold the maggots between
their mandibles and induce them to spin together the leaves of
trees from which they form their shelters, as the adult ants have
no silk-producing organs.</p>

<p><i>Origin of Societies.</i>&mdash;Ant-colonies are founded either by a single
female or by several in association. The foundress of the nest
lays eggs and at first feeds and rears the larvae, the earliest of
which develop into workers. C. Janet observed that in a nest of
<i>Lasius alienus</i>, established by a single female, the first workers
emerged from their cocoons on the 102nd day. These workers
then take on themselves the labour of the colony, some collecting
food, which they transfer to their comrades within the nest whose
duty is to tend and feed the larvae. The foundress-queen is now
waited on by the workers, who supply her with food and spare her
all cares of work, so that henceforth she may devote her whole
energies to egg-laying. The population of the colony increases
fast, and a well-grown nest contains several &ldquo;queens&rdquo; and males,
besides a large number of workers. One of the most interesting
features of ant-societies is the dimorphism or polymorphism that
may often be seen among the workers, the same species being
represented by two or more forms. Thus the British &ldquo;wood ant&rdquo;
(<i>Formica rufa</i>) has a smaller and a larger race of workers
(&ldquo;minor&rdquo; and &ldquo;major&rdquo; forms), while in <i>Ponera</i> we find a blind
race of workers and another race provided with eyes, and in <i>Atta</i>,
<i>Eciton</i> and other genera, four or five forms of workers are produced,
the largest of which, with huge heads and elongate trenchant
mandibles, are known as the &ldquo;soldier&rdquo; caste. The development
of such diversely-formed insects as the offspring of the unmodified
females which show none of their peculiarities raises many points
of difficulty for students in heredity. It is thought that the
differences are, in part at least, due to differences in the nature of
the food supplied to larvae, which are apparently all alike. But
the ovaries of worker ants are in some cases sufficiently developed
for the production of eggs, which may give rise parthenogenetically
to male, queen or worker offspring.</p>

<p><i>Food.</i>&mdash;Different kinds of ants vary greatly in the substances
which they use for food. Honey forms the staple nourishment
of many ants, some of the workers seeking nectar from flowers,
working it up into honey within their stomachs and regurgitating
it so as to feed their comrades within the nest, who, in their turn,
pass it on to the grubs. A curious specialization of certain
workers in connexion with the transference of honey has been
demonstrated by H.C. McCook in the American genus <i>Myrmecocystus</i>,
and by later observers in Australian and African
species of <i>Plagiolepis</i> and allied genera. The workers in question
remain within the nest, suspended by their feet, and serve as
living honey-pots for the colony, becoming so distended by the
supplies of honey poured into their mouths by their foraging
comrades that their abdomens become sub-globular, the pale
intersegmental membrane being tightly stretched between the
widely-separated dark sclerites. The &ldquo;nurse&rdquo; workers in the
nest can then draw their supplies from these &ldquo;honey-pots.&rdquo;
Very many ants live by preying upon various insects, such as
the British &ldquo;red ants&rdquo; with well-developed stings (<i>Myrmica
rubra</i>), and the notorious &ldquo;driver ants&rdquo; of Africa and America,
the old-world species of which belong to <i>Dorylus</i> and allied genera,
and the new-world species to <i>Eciton</i> (fig. 2, <i>2, 3</i>). In these ants
the difference between the large, heavy, winged males and females,
and the small, long-legged, active workers, is so great, that various
forms of the same species have been often referred to distinct
genera; in <i>Eciton</i>, for example, the female has a single petiolate
abdominal segment, the worker two. The workers of these
ants range over the country in large armies, killing and carrying
off all the insects and spiders that they find and sometimes
attacking vertebrates. They have been known to enter
human dwellings, removing all the verminous insects contained
therein. These driver ants shelter in temporary nests made in
hollow trees or similar situations, where the insects may be seen,
according to T. Belt, &ldquo;clustered together in a dense mass like
a great swarm of bees hanging from the roof.&rdquo;</p>

2. <i>Eciton drepanophora</i>; 3. <i>Eciton erratica</i>.</td></tr></table>

<p>The harvesting habits of certain ants have long been known, the
subterranean store-houses of Mediterranean species of <i>Aphaenogaster</i>
having been described by J.T. Moggridge and A. Forel,
and the complex industries of the Texan <i>Pogonomyrmex barbatus</i>
by H.C. McCook and W.M. Wheeler. The colonies of <i>Aphaenogaster</i>
occupy nests extending over an area of fifty to a hundred
square yards several feet below the surface of the ground. Into
these underground chambers the ants carry seeds of grasses and
other plants of which they accumulate large stores. The species
of <i>Pogonomyrmex</i> strip the husks from the seeds and carry them
out of the nest, making a refuse heap near the entrance. The
seeds are harvested from various grasses, especially from
<i>Aristida oligantha</i>, a species known as &ldquo;ant rice,&rdquo; which often
grows in quantity close to the site selected for the nest, but the
statement that the ants deliberately sow this grass is an error,
due, according to Wheeler, to the sprouting of germinating seeds
which the ants have turned out of their store-chambers.</p>

<p>Perhaps no ants have such remarkable habits as those of the
genus <i>Atta</i>,&mdash;the leaf-cutting ants of tropical America (fig. 2, <i>1</i>).
There are several forms of worker in these species, some with
enormous heads, which remain in the underground nests, while
their smaller comrades scour the country in search of suitable
trees, which they ascend, biting off small circular pieces from the
leaves, and carrying them off to the nests. Their labour often
results in the complete defoliation of the tree. The tracks along
which the ants carry the leaves to their nests are often in part
subterranean. H.C. McCook describes an almost straight tunnel,
nearly 450 ft. long, made by <i>Atta fervens</i>.</p>

<p>Within the nest, the leaves are cut into very minute fragments
and gathered into small spherical heaps forming a spongy mass,
which&mdash;according to the researches of A. Möller&mdash;serves as the
substratum for a special fungus (<i>Rozites gongylophora</i>), the staple
food of the ants. The insects cultivate their fungus, weeding out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page87" id="page87"></a>87</span>
mould and bacterial growths, and causing the appearance, on the
surface of their &ldquo;mushroom garden,&rdquo; of numerous small white
bodies formed by swollen ends of the fungus hyphae. When
the fungus is grown elsewhere than in the ants&rsquo; nest it produces
gonidia instead of the white masses on which the ants feed,
hence it seems that these masses are indeed produced as the
result of some unknown cultural process. Other genera of
South American ants&mdash;<i>Apterostigma</i> and <i>Cyphomyrmex</i>&mdash;make
similar fungal cultivations, but they use wood, grain or dung
as the substratum instead of leaf fragments. Each kind of ant
is so addicted to its own particular fungal food that it refuses
disdainfully, even when hungry, the produce of an alien nest.</p>

<p><i>Guests of Ants.</i>&mdash;Many ants feed largely and some almost
entirely on the saccharine secretions of other insects, the best
known of which are the Aphides (plant-lice or &ldquo;green-fly&rdquo;).
This consideration leads us to one of the most remarkable and
fascinating features of ant-communities&mdash;the presence in the
nests of insects and other small arthropods, which are tended
and cared for by the ants as their &ldquo;guests,&rdquo; rendering to the ants
in return the sweet food which they desire. The relation between
ants and aphids has often been compared to that between men
and milch cattle. Sir J. Lubbock (Lord Avebury) states that
the common British yellow ants (<i>Lasius flavus</i>) collect flocks of
root-feeding aphids in their underground nests, protect them,
build earthen shelters over them, and take the greatest
care of their eggs. Other ants, such as the British black garden
species (<i>L. niger</i>), go after the aphids that frequent the shoots of
plants. Many species of aphid migrate from one plant to another
at certain stages in their life-cycle when their numbers have
very largely increased, and F.M. Webster has observed ants,
foreseeing this emigration, to carry aphids from apple trees to
grasses. It has been shown by M. Büsgen that the sweet secretion
(honey-dew) of the aphids is not derived, as generally believed,
from the paired cornicles on the fifth abdominal segment, but
from the intestine, whence it exudes in drops and is swallowed
by the ants.</p>

<p>Besides the aphids, other insects, such as scale insects (<i>Coccidae</i>),
caterpillars of blue butterflies (<i>Lycaenidae</i>), and numerous
beetles, furnish the ants with nutrient secretions. The number
of species of beetles that inhabit ants&rsquo; nests is almost incredibly
large, and most of these are never found elsewhere, being blind,
helpless and dependent on the ants&rsquo; care for protection and
food; these beetles belong for the most part to the families
<i>Pselaphidae, Paussidae</i> and <i>Staphylinidae</i>. Spring-tails and
bristle-tails (order <i>Aptera</i>) of several species also frequent ants&rsquo;
nests. While some of these &ldquo;guest&rdquo; insects produce secretions
that furnish the ants with food, some seem to be useless inmates
of the nest, obtaining food from the ants and giving nothing
in return. Others again play the part of thieves in the ant
society; C. Janet observed a small bristle-tail (<i>Lepismima</i>)
to lurk beneath the heads of two Lasius workers, while one passed
food to the other, in order to steal the drop of nourishment and
to make off with it. The same naturalist describes the association
with Lasius of small mites (<i>Antennophorus</i>) which are carried
about by the worker ants, one of which may have a mite beneath
her mouth, and another on either side of her abdomen. On patting
their carrier or some passing ant, the mites are supplied with food,
no service being rendered by them in return for the ants&rsquo; care.
Perhaps the ants derive from these seemingly useless guests the
same satisfaction as we obtain by keeping pet animals. Recent
advance in our knowledge of the guests and associates of ants is
due principally to E. Wasmann, who has compiled a list of nearly
1500 species of insects, arachnids and crustaceans, inhabiting
ants&rsquo; nests. The warmth, shelter and abundant food in the
nests, due both to the fresh supplies brought in by the ants and
to the large amount of waste matter that accumulates, must
prove strongly attractive to the various &ldquo;guests.&rdquo; Some of the
inmates of ants&rsquo; nests are here for the purpose of preying upon the
ants or their larvae, so that we find all kinds of relations between
the owners of the nests and their companions, from mutual benefit
to active hostility.</p>

<p>Among these associations or guests other species of ants are
not wanting. For example, a minute species (<i>Solenopsis fugax</i>)
lives in a compound nest with various species of <i>Formica</i>,
forming narrow galleries which open into the larger galleries
of its host. The <i>Solenopsis</i> can make its way into the territory
of the <i>Formica</i> to steal the larvae which serve it as food, but the
<i>Formica</i> is too large to pursue the thief when it returns to its own
galleries.</p>

<p><i>Slaves.</i>&mdash;Several species of ants are found in association with
another species which stands to them in the relation of slave to
master. <i>Formica sanguinea</i> is a well-known European slave-making
ant that inhabits England; its workers raid the nests of
<i>F. fusca</i> and other species, and carry off to their own nests pupae
from which workers are developed that live contentedly as
slaves of their captors. <i>F. sanguinea</i> can live either with or
without slaves, but another European ant (<i>Polyergus rufescens</i>)
is so dependent on its slaves&mdash;various species of <i>Formica</i>&mdash;that
its workers are themselves unable to feed the larvae. The
remarkable genus <i>Anergates</i> has no workers, and its wingless
males and females are served by communities of <i>Tetramorium
cespitum</i> (fig. 3).</p>

<p><i>Senses and Intelligence of Ants.</i>&mdash;That ants possess highly
developed senses and the power of communicating with one
another has long been known to students of their habits; the
researches of P. Huber and Sir J. Lubbock (Lord Avebury) on
these subjects are familiar to all naturalists. The insects are
guided by light, being very sensitive to ultra-violet rays, and also
by scent and hearing. Recent experiments by A.M. Fielde
show that an ant follows her own old track by a scent exercised
by the tenth segment of the feeler, recognizes other inmates of
her nest by a sense of smell resident in the eleventh segment, is
guided to the eggs, maggots and pupae, which she has to tend,
by sensation through the eighth and ninth segments, and
appreciates the general smell of the nest itself by means of organs
in the twelfth segment. Lubbock&rsquo;s experiments of inducing
ants to seek objects that had been removed show that they are
guided by scent rather than by sight, and that any disturbance
of their surroundings often causes great uncertainty in their
actions. Ants invite one another to work, or ask for food from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>88</span>
one another, by means of pats with the feelers; and they respond
to the solicitations of their guest&mdash;beetles or mites, who ask for
food by patting the ants with their feet. In all probability the
actions of ants are for the most part instinctive or reflex, and some
observers, such as A. Bethe, deny them all claim to psychical
qualities. But it seems impossible to doubt that in many cases
ants behave in a manner that must be considered intelligent,
that they can learn by experience and that they possess memory.
Lubbock goes so far as to conclude the account of his experiments
with the remark that &ldquo;It is difficult altogether to deny them
the gift of reason ... their mental powers differ from those of
men, not so much in kind as in degree.&rdquo; Wasmann considers
that ants are neither miniature human beings nor mere reflex
automata, and most students of their habits will probably accept
this intermediate position as the most satisfactory. C.L.
Morgan sums up a discussion on Lubbock&rsquo;s experiments in which
the ants failed to utilize particles of earth for bridge-making,
with the suggestive remark that &ldquo;What these valuable experiments
seem to show is that the ant, probably the most intelligent
of all insects, has no claim to be regarded as a rational being.&rdquo;
Nevertheless, ants can teach &ldquo;rational beings&rdquo; many valuable
lessons.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Bibliography</span>.&mdash;The literature on ants is so vast that it is only
possible to refer the reader to a few of the most important works on
the family. Pierre Huber&rsquo;s <i>Traité des moeurs des fourmis indigènes</i>
(Genève, 1810) is the most famous of the older memoirs. H.W.
Bates, <i>A Naturalist on the Amazons</i>; T. Belt, <i>A Naturalist in
Nicaragua</i>; H.C. McCook, <i>Agricultural Ant of Texas</i> (Philadelphia,
1880); and A. Moller&rsquo;s paper in <i>Botan. Mitt, aus den Tropen</i>,
(1893), contain classical observations on American species. Sir J.
Lubbock&rsquo;s (Lord Avebury) <i>Ants, Bees and Wasps</i> (London 1882),
dealing with British and European species, has been followed by
numerous important papers by A. Forel and C. Emery in various
Swiss and German periodicals, and especially by C. Janet in his
<i>Êtudes sur les fourmis, les guêpes et les abeilles</i> (Paris, &amp;c., 1893-1904).
Forel (<i>Ann. Soc. Ent. Belg.</i> xlvii., 1893, <i>Journ. Bomnay N.H.
Soc.</i> 1900-1903, and <i>Biologia Cent. Americana</i>) and Emery (<i>Zool.
Jahrb. Syst.</i> viii., 1896) have written on the classification of the
<i>Formicidae</i>. Among recent American writers on habit may be
mentioned W.M. Wheeler (<i>American Naturalist</i>, 1900-1902) and
A.M. Fielde (<i>Proc. Acad. Sci. Philadelphia</i>, 1901); E. Wasmann
(<i>Kritisches Verzeichniss der myrmecophilen und termitophilen Arthropoden</i>,
Berlin, 1894, and <i>3<span class="sp">me</span> Congrès Intern. Zool.</i> 1895) is the great
authority on ant-guests and associates. D. Sharp&rsquo;s general account
of ants in the <i>Cambridge Nat. Hist</i>. (vol. vi., 1898) is excellent. For
discussions on intelligence see A. Bethe, <i>Journ. f. d. ges. Physiol.</i>
lxx. (1898); Wasmann, <i>Die psychischen Fahigkeiten der Ameisen</i>
(Stuttgart, 1899); C. Ll. Morgan, <i>Animal Behaviour</i> (London, 1900.)</p>

the friendly relations then existing between Athens and Persia
by offering to recognize Persian claims to the whole of Asia Minor.
The Athenians sent an embassy under Conon to counteract his
efforts. Tiribazus, who was favourable to Sparta, threw Conon
into prison, but Artaxerxes II. (Mnemon) disapproved and
recalled his satrap. In 388 Antalcidas, then commander of the
Spartan fleet, accompanied Tiribazus to the Persian court, and
secured the active assistance of Persia against Athens. The
success of his naval operations in the neighbourhood of the
Hellespont was such that Athens was glad to accept terms of
peace (the &ldquo;Peace of Antalcidas&rdquo;), by which (1) the whole of
Asia Minor, with the islands of Clazomenae and Cyprus, was
recognized as subject to Persia, (2) all other Greek cities&mdash;so far
as they were not under Persian rule&mdash;were to be independent,
except Lemnos, Imbros and Scyros, which were to belong, as
formerly, to the Athenians. The terms were announced to the
Greek envoys at Sardis in the winter 387-386, and were finally

W.S.W. of Tamatave, the principal seaport of the island, with
which it is connected by railway, and for about 60 m. along the
coast lagoons, a service of small steamers. The city occupies a
commanding position, being chiefly built on the summit and slopes
of a long and narrow rocky ridge, which extends north and south
for about 2½ m., dividing to the north in a Y-shape, and rising at
its highest point to 690 ft. above the extensive rice plain to the
west, which is itself 4060 ft. above sea-level. For long only the
principal village of the Hova chiefs, Antananarivo advanced
in importance as those chiefs made themselves sovereigns of
the greater part of Madagascar, until it became a town of some
80,000 inhabitants. Until 1869 all buildings within the city
proper were of wood or rush, but even then it possessed several
timber palaces of considerable size, the largest being 120 ft.
high. These crown the summit of the central portion of the ridge;
and the largest palace, with its lofty roof and towers, is the most
conspicuous object from every point of view. Since the introduction
of stone and brick, the whole city has been rebuilt and
now contains numerous structures of some architectural pretension,
the royal palaces, the houses formerly belonging to the
prime minister and nobles, the French residency, the Anglican
and Roman Catholic cathedrals, several stone churches, as well
as others of brick, colleges, schools, hospitals, courts of justice
and other government buildings, and hundreds of good dwelling-houses.
Since the French conquest in 1895 good roads have been
constructed throughout the city, broad flights of steps connect
places too steep for the formation of carriage roads, and the
central space, called Andohalo, has become a handsome <i>place</i>,
with walks and terraces, flower-beds and trees. A small park has
been laid out near the residency, and the planting of trees and
the formation of gardens in various parts of the city give it a
bright and attractive appearance. Water is obtained from
springs at the foot of the hill, but it is proposed to bring an
abundant supply from the river Ikopa, which skirts the capital
to the south and west. The population, including that of the
suburbs, is 69,000 (1907). The city is guarded by two forts
built on hills to the east and south-west respectively. Including
an Anglican and a Roman Catholic cathedral, there are about
fifty churches in the city and its suburbs, as well as a Mahommedan
mosque.</p>

<p><span class="bold">&lsquo;ANTARA IBN SHADD&#256;D,<a name="ar73" id="ar73"></a></span> Arabian poet and warrior of the
6th century, was famous both for his poetry and his adventurous
life. His chief poem is contained in the <i>Mo&lsquo;allakât</i>. The account
of his life forms the basis of a long and extravagant romance.
His father Shadd&#257;d was a soldier, his mother Zab&#363;ba a negro
slave. Neglected at first, he soon claimed attention and respect
for himself, and by his remarkable personal qualities and courage
in battle he gained his freedom and the acknowledgment of his
father. He took part in the great war between the related
tribes of Abs and Dhuby&#257;n, which began over a contest of
horses and was named after them the war of D&#257;his and Ghabr&#257;.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>89</span>
He died in a fight against the tribe of &#7788;ai. His poems, which
are chiefly concerned with fighting or with his love for Abla,
are published in W. Ahlwardt&rsquo;s <i>The Diwans of the six ancient
Arabic Poets</i> (London, 1870); they have also been published
separately at Beirût (1888). As regards their genuineness, cf.
W. Ahlwardt&rsquo;s <i>Bemerkungen uber die Aechtheit der alten arabichen
Gedichte</i> (Greifswald, 1872), pp. 50 ff. <i>The Romance of &lsquo;Antar</i>
(Sîrat &lsquo;Antar ibn Shadd&#257;d) is a work which was long handed
down by oral tradition only, has grown to immense proportions
and has been published in 32 vols. at Cairo, 1307 (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1889),
and in 10 vols. at Beirût, 1871. It was partly translated by
Terrick Hamilton under the title <i>&lsquo;Antar, a Bedoueen Romance</i>
(4 vols., London, 1820).</p>

northern constellation of <i>Ursa Major</i>), the epithet applied to
the region (including both the ocean and the lands) round the
South Pole. The Antarctic circle is drawn at 66° 30&prime; S., but

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANTEATER,<a name="ar75" id="ar75"></a></span> a term applied to several mammals, but (zoologically
at any rate) specially indicating the tropical American
anteaters of the family <i>Myrmecophagidae</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Edentata</a></span>).
The typical and largest representative of the group is the great
anteater or ant-bear (<i>Myrmecophaga jubata</i>), an animal measuring
4 ft. in length without the tail, and 2 ft. in height at the shoulder.
Its prevailing colour is grey, with a broad black band, bordered
with white, commencing on the chest, and passing obliquely
over the shoulder, diminishing gradually in breadth as it approaches
the loins, where it ends in a point. It is extensively
distributed in the tropical parts of South and Central America,
frequenting low swampy savannas, along the banks of rivers,
and the depths of the humid forests, but is nowhere abundant.
Its food consists mainly of termites, to obtain which it opens
their nests with its powerful sharp anterior claws, and as the
insects swarm to the damaged part of their dwelling, it draws
them into its mouth by means of its long, flexible, rapidly
moving tongue covered with glutinous saliva. The great
anteater is terrestrial in habits, not burrowing underground like
armadillos. Though generally an inoffensive animal, when
attacked it can defend itself vigorously and effectively with its
sabre-like anterior claws. The female produces a single young
at a birth. The tamandua anteaters, as typified by <i>Tamandua</i>
(or <i>Uroleptes</i>) <i>tetradactyla</i>, are much smaller than the great
anteater, and differ essentially from it in their habits, being
mainly arboreal. They inhabit the dense primeval forests
of South and Central America. The usual colour is yellowish-white,
with a broad black lateral band, covering nearly the whole
of the side of the body.</p>

<p>The little or two-toed anteater (<i>Cyclopes</i> or <i>Cycloturus didactylus</i>)
is a native of the hottest parts of South and Central
America, and about the size of a rat, of a general yellowish colour,
and exclusively arboreal in its habits. The name scaly anteater
is applied to the pangolin (<i>q.v.</i>); the banded anteater (<i>Myrmecobius
fasciatus</i>) is a marsupial, and the spiny anteater (<i>Echidna</i>)
is one of the monotremes (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Marsupialia</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Monotremata</a></span>).</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANTE-CHAPEL,<a name="ar76" id="ar76"></a></span> the term given to that portion of a chapel
which lies on the western side of the choir screen. In some of
the colleges at Oxford and Cambridge the ante-chapel is carried
north and south across the west end of the chapel, constituting
a western transept or narthex. This model, based on Merton
College chapel (13th century), of which only chancel and transept
were built though a nave was projected, was followed at
Wadham, New and Magdalen Colleges, Oxford, in the new
chapel of St John&rsquo;s College, Cambridge, and in Eton College.
In Jesus College, Cambridge, the transept and a short nave
constitute the ante-chapel; in Clare College an octagonal
vestibule serves the same purpose; and in Christ&rsquo;s, Trinity and
King&rsquo;s Colleges, Cambridge, the ante-chapel is a portion of the
main chapel, divided off from the chancel by the choir screen.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANTE-CHOIR,<a name="ar77" id="ar77"></a></span> the term given to the space enclosed in a
church between the outer gate or railing of the rood screen and
the door of the screen; sometimes there is only one rail, gate or
door, but in Westminster Abbey it is equal in depth to one bay
of the nave. The ante-choir is also called the &ldquo;fore choir.&rdquo;</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANTE-FIXAE<a name="ar78" id="ar78"></a></span> (from Lat. <i>antefigere</i>, to fasten before), the
vertical blocks which terminate the covering tiles of the roof of
a Greek temple; as spaced they take the place of the cymatium
and form a cresting along the sides of the temple. The face of
the ante-fixae was richly carved with the anthemion (<i>q.v.</i>)
ornament.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANTELOPE,<a name="ar79" id="ar79"></a></span> a zoological name which, so far as can be determined,
appears to trace its origin, through the Latin, to <i>Pantholops</i>,
the old Coptic, and <i>Antholops</i>, the late Greek name of the fabled
unicorn. Its adoption by the languages of Europe cannot
apparently be traced farther back than the 4th century of our
era, at which date it was employed to designate an imaginary
animal living on the banks of the Euphrates. By the earlier
English naturalists, and afterwards by Buffon, it was, however,
applied to the Indian blackbuck, which is thus entitled to rank
as <i>the</i> antelope. It follows that the subfamily typified by this
species, in which are included the gazelles, is the one to which
alone the term antelopes should be applied if it were employed
in a restricted and definable sense.</p>

<p>Although most people have a general vague idea of what
constitutes an &ldquo;antelope,&rdquo; yet the group of animals thus
designated is one that does not admit of accurate limitations or
definition. Some, for instance, may consider that the chamois
and the so-called white goat of the Rocky Mountains are entitled
to be included in the group; but this is not the view held by the
authors of the <i>Book of Antelopes</i> referred to below; and, as a
matter of fact, the term is only a vague designation for a number
of more or less distinct groups of hollow-horned ruminants
which do not come under the designation of cattle, sheep or
goats; and in reality there ought to be a distinct English group-name
for each subfamily into which &ldquo;antelopes&rdquo; are subdivided.</p>

<p>The great majority of antelopes, exclusive of the doubtful
chamois group (which, however, will be included in the present
article), are African, although the gazelles are to a considerable
extent an Asiatic group. They include ruminants varying in
size from a hare to an ox; and comprise about 150 species,
although this number is subject to considerable variation according
to personal views as to the limitations of species and races.
No true antelopes are American, the prongbuck (<i>Antilocapra</i>),
which is commonly called &ldquo;antelope&rdquo; in the United States,
representing a distinct group; while, as already mentioned, the
Rocky Mountain or white goat stands on the borderland between
antelopes and goats.</p>

<tr><td class="caption1"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 1.&mdash;Female Bushbuck
(<i>Tragelaphus scriptus</i>).</td></tr></table>

<p>The first group, or <i>Tragelaphinae</i>, is represented by the African
elands (<i>Taurotragus</i>), bongo (<i>Boöcercus</i>), kudus (<i>Strepsiceros</i>) and
bushbucks or harnessed antelopes (<i>Tragelaphus</i>), and the Indian
nilgai (<i>Boselaphus</i>). Except in the bongo and elands, horns are
present only in the males, and these are angulated and generally
spirally twisted, and without rings. The muzzle is naked, small
glands are present on the face below the eyes, and the tail is
comparatively long. The colours are often brilliant; white
spots and stripes being prevalent. The harnessed antelopes, or
bushbucks, are closely allied to the kudus, from which they chiefly
differ by the spiral formed by the horns generally having fewer
turns. They include some of the most brilliantly coloured of all
antelopes; the ornamentation taking the form of vertical white
lines and rows of spots. Usually the sexes differ in colour.
Whereas most of the species have hoofs of normal shape, in some,
such as the nakong, or situtunga (<i>Tragelaphus spekei</i>), these are
greatly elongated, in order to be suited for walking in soft mud,
and these have accordingly been separated as <i>Limnotragus</i>. The
last-named species spends most of its time in water, where it may
be observed not infrequently among the reeds with all but its
head and horns submerged. The true or smaller bushbucks,
represented by the widely spread <i>Tragelaphus scriptus</i>, with
several local races (fig. 1) are sometimes separated as <i>Sylvicapra</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page90" id="page90"></a>90</span>
leaving the genus <i>Tragelaphus</i> to be represented by the larger
<i>T. angasi</i> and its relatives. The genus <i>Strepsiceros</i> is represented
by the true or great kudu (<i>S. capensis</i> or <i>S. strepsiceros</i>), fig. 2,
ranging from the Cape to Somaliland, and the smaller <i>S. imberbis</i>
of North-East Africa, which has no throat-fringe. The large and
brightly coloured bongo (<i>Boöcercus euryceros</i>) of the equatorial
forest-districts serves in some respects to connect the bushbucks
with the elands, having horns in both sexes, and a tufted tail,
but a brilliant orange coat
with vertical white stripes. Still
larger are the elands, of which
the typical <i>Taurotragus oryx</i> of
the Cape is uniformly sandy-coloured,
although stripes appear
in the more northern <i>T.
o. livingstonei</i>, while the black-necked
eland (<i>T. derbianus</i>) of
Senegambia and the Bahr-el-Ghazal
district is a larger and
more brilliantly coloured animal.
The small horns and
bluish-grey colour of the adult
bulls serve to distinguish the
Indian nilgai (<i>q.v.</i>), <i>Boselaphus tragocamdus</i>, from the other
members of the subfamily.</p>

<p>The second group, which is mainly African, but also represented
in Syria, is that of the <i>Hippotraginae</i>, typified by the
sable antelope (<i>Hippotragus niger</i>) and roan antelope (<i>H. equinus</i>),
but also including the oryxes (<i>Oryx</i>) and addax. These are for
the most part large antelopes, with long cylindrical horns, which
are present in both sexes, hairy muzzles, no face-glands, long
tufted tails and tall thick molars of the ox-type. In <i>Hippotragus</i>
the stout and thickly ringed horns rise vertically from a
ridge above the eyes at an obtuse angle to the plane of the lower
part of the face, and then sweep backwards in a bold curve;
while there are tufts of long white hairs near the eyes. The sable
antelope is a southern species in which both sexes are black or
blackish when adult, while the lighter-coloured and larger roan
antelope has a much wider distribution. The South African
blauwbok (<i>H. leucophaeus</i>) is extinct. In the addax (<i>Addax
nasomaculatus</i>), which is a distinct species common to North
Africa and Syria, the ringed horns form an open spiral
ascending in the plane of the face, and there is long, shaggy,
dark hair on the fore-quarters in winter. The various species
of oryx differ from <i>Hippotragus</i> by the absence of the white
eye-tufts, and by the horns sloping backwards in the plane of
the face. In the South African gemsbuck (<i>Oryx gazella</i>), fig. 3,
the East African beisa or true oryx (<i>O. beisa</i>), and the white
Arabian (<i>O. beatrix</i>) the horns are straight, but in the North
African white oryx or algazel (<i>O. leucoryx</i> or <i>O. algazal</i>) they are
scimitar-shaped, the colour of this species being white and
pale chestnut (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Addax</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Oryx</a></span>, and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Sable Antelope</a></span>).</p>

<p>The third subfamily is the <i>Antilopinae</i>, the members of which
have a much wider geographical range than either of the foregoing
groups. The subfamily is characterized by the narrow
crowns of the molars, which are similar to those of sheep, and
the hairy muzzle. Generally there are face-glands below the
eyes; and the tail is moderate or short. Pits are present in
the forehead of the skull, and the horns are ringed for part of
their length, with a compressed base, their form being often lyrate,
but sometimes spiral. Lateral hoofs are generally present.</p>

<tr><td class="caption"><span class="sc">Fig.</span> 3.&mdash;Gemsbuck, or Cape Oryx (<i>Oryx gazella</i>).</td></tr></table>

<p>Gazelles (<i>Gazella</i>), which form by far the largest genus of the
subfamily, are inhabitants of open and frequently more or less
desert districts. They are mostly of a sandy colour, with dark
and light markings on the face, and often a dark band on the
flanks. The horns are more or less lyrate, and generally developed
in both sexes; there are frequently brushes of hair on the knees.
Gazelles may be divided into groups. The one to which the North
African <i>G. dorcas</i> belongs is characterized by the presence of
lyrate or sub-lyrate horns in both sexes, and by the white of
the buttocks not extending on to the haunches. Nearly allied
is the group including the Indian <i>G. bennetti</i> and the Arabian
<i>G. arabica</i>, in which the horns have a somewhat S-shaped
curvature in profile. In the group represented by the African
<i>G. granti</i>, <i>G. thomsoni</i>, <i>G. mohr</i>, &amp;c., the white of the buttocks
often sends a prolongation on to the flanks, the horns are long
and the size is large. Lastly, the Central Asian <i>G. gutturosa</i>,
<i>G. subgutturosa</i> and <i>G. picticaudata</i> form a group in which the
females are hornless and the face-markings inconspicuous or
wanting.</p>

<p>The South African springbuck (<i>Antidorcas euchore</i>) is nearly
related to the gazelles, from which it is distinguished by the
presence on the middle line of the loins of an evertible pouch,
lined with long white hairs capable of erection. It has also one
premolar tooth less in the lower jaw. Formerly these beautiful
antelopes existed in countless numbers on the plains of South
Africa, and were in the habit of migrating in droves which completely
filled entire valleys. Now they are comparatively rare.</p>

<p>The dibatag or Clarke&rsquo;s gazelle (<i>Ammodorcas clarkei</i>), of Somaliland,
forms a kind of connecting link between the true gazelles
and the gerenuk, this being especially shown in the skull. The
face has the ordinary gazelle-markings; but the rather short
horns&mdash;which are wanting in the female&mdash;have a peculiar upward
and forward curvature, unlike that obtaining in the gazelles
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page91" id="page91"></a>91</span>
and somewhat resembling that of the reedbuck. The neck is
longer and more slender than in ordinary gazelles, and the tail
is likewise relatively long. Although local, these animals are
fairly common in the interior of Somaliland, where they are
known by the name of dibatag. In running, the head and neck
are thrown backwards, while the tail is turned forwards over
the back.</p>

<p>The East African gerenuk (<i>q.v.</i>), or Waller&rsquo;s gazelle (<i>Lithocranius
walleri</i>), of which two races have been named, is a very
remarkable ruminant, distinguished not only by its exceedingly
elongated neck and limbs, but also by the peculiar hooked form
of the very massive horns of the bucks, the dense structure and
straight profile of the skull, and the extreme slenderness of the
lower jaw.</p>

<p>A still more aberrant gazelle is a small North-East African species
known as the beira (<i>Dorcatragus melanotis</i>), with very short horns,
large hoofs and a general appearance recalling that of some of the
members of the subfamily <i>Neotraginae</i>, although in other respects
gazelle-like. The blackbuck (<i>Antilope cervicapra</i> or <i>A.
bezoartica</i>) of India, a species taking its name from the deep black coat
assumed by the adult bucks, and easily recognized by the graceful,
spirally twisted horns ornamenting the heads of that sex, is
now the sole representative of the genus <i>Antilope</i>, formerly
taken to embrace the whole of the true antelopes. Large face-glands
are characteristic of the species, which inhabits the open
plains of India in large herds. They leap high in the air, like
the springbuck, when on the move.</p>

<p>With the palla (<i>q.v.</i>), or impala (<i>Aepyceros melampus</i>), we reach
an exclusively African genus, characterized by the lyrate horns
of the bucks, the absence of lateral hoofs, and the presence of
a pair of glands with black tufts of hair on the hind-feet.</p>

<p>The sheep-like saiga (<i>q.v.</i>), <i>Saiga tatarica</i>, of the Kirghiz steppes
stands apart from all other antelopes by its curiously puffed
and trunk-like nose, which can be wrinkled up when the animal
is feeding and has the nostrils opening downwards. More or
less nearly related to the saiga is the chiru (<i>q.v.</i>), <i>Pantholops
hodgsoni</i> of Tibet, characterized by the long upright black horns
of the bucks, and the less convex nose, in which the nostrils
open anteriorly instead of downwards.</p>

<p>The <i>Neotraginae</i> (or <i>Nanotraginae</i>) form an exclusively
African group of small-sized antelopes divided into several,
for the most part nearly related, genera. Almost the only
characters they possess in common are the short and spike-like
horns of the bucks, which are ringed at the base, with smooth
tips, and the large size of the face-gland, which opens by a
circular aperture. <i>Neotragus</i> is represented by the pigmy royal
antelope (<i>N. pygmaeus</i>) of Guinea; <i>Hylarnus</i> includes one species
from Cameroon and a second from the Semliki forest; while
<i>Nesotragus</i> comprises the East African suni antelopes, <i>N.
moschatus</i> and <i>N. livingstonianus</i>. All three might, however,
well be included in <i>Neotragus</i>. The royal antelope is the smallest
of the Bovidae.</p>

<p>The steinbok (<i>Rhaphiceros campestris</i>) and the <i>grysbok</i> (<i>R.
melanotis</i>) are the best-known representatives of a group
characterized by the vertical direction of the horns and the small
gland-pit in the skull; lateral hoofs being absent in the first-named
and present in the second. A bare gland-patch behind
the ear serves to distinguish the oribis or ourebis, as typified by
<i>Oribia montana</i> of the Cape; lateral hoofs being present and
the face-pit large.</p>

<p>From all the preceding the tiny dik-diks (<i>Madoqua</i>) of North-East
Africa differ by their hairy noses, expanded in some species
into short trunks; while the widely spread klipspringer (<i>q.v.</i>),
<i>Oreotragus saltator</i>, with its several local races, is unfailingly
distinguishable by its rounded blunt hoofs and thick, brittle,
golden-flecked hair.</p>

<p>In some respects connecting the last group with the <i>Cervicaprinae</i>
is the rhebok, or vaal-rhebok (<i>Pelea capreolus</i>), a grey
antelope of the size of a roebuck, with small upright horns in the
bucks recalling those of the last group, and small lateral hoofs,
but no face-glands. In size and several structural features it
approximates to the more typical <i>Cervicaprinae</i>, as represented
by the reedbuck (<i>Cervicapra</i>), and the waterbucks and kobs
(<i>Cobus</i> or <i>Kobus</i>), all of which are likewise African. These are
medium-sized or large antelopes with naked muzzles, narrow
sheep-like upper molars, fairly long tails, rudimentary or no
face-glands, and pits in the frontal bones of the skull. Reedbuck
(<i>q.v.</i>), or rietbok (<i>Cervicapra</i>), are foxy-red antelopes ranging
in size from a fallow-deer to a roe, with thick bushy tails, forwardly
curving black horns, and a bare patch of glandular skin
behind each ear. They keep to open country near water. The
waterbuck (<i>q.v.</i>), <i>Cobus</i>, on the other hand, actually seek refuge
from pursuit in the water. They have heavily fringed necks,
tufted tails, long lyrate horns in the bucks (fig. 4) but no glandular
ear-patches. The true waterbuck (<i>C. ellipsiprymnus</i>), and the
defassa or sing-sing (<i>C. defassa</i>), are the two largest species,
equal in size to red deer, and grey or reddish in colour. Of the
smaller forms or kobs, <i>C. maria</i> and <i>C. leucotis</i> of the swamps of
the White Nile are characterized by the black coats of the adult
bucks; the West African <i>C. cob</i>, and its East African representative
<i>C. thomasi</i>, are wholly red antelopes of the size of
roedeer; the lichi or lechwe (<i>C. lichi</i>) is characterized by its
long horns, black fore-legs and superior size; while the puku
(<i>C. vardoni</i>), which is also a swamp-loving species from
South-Central Africa, differs from the three preceding species by the
fore-legs being uniformly foxy.</p>

<p>The duikers, or duikerboks (<i>Cephalophus</i>), of Africa, which
range in size from a large hare to a fallow-deer, typify the subfamily
<i>Cephalophinae</i>, characterized by the spike-like horns of
the bucks, the elongated aperture of the face-glands, the naked
muzzle, the relatively short tail, and the square-crowned upper
molars; lateral hoofs being present. In the duikers themselves
the single pair of horns is set in the midst of a tuft of long hairs,
and the face-gland opens in a long naked line on the side of the
face above the muzzle. The group is represented in India by the
chousingha or four-horned antelope (<i>Tetraceros quadricornis</i>),
generally distinguished by the feature from which it takes its
name (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Duiker</a></span>).</p>

<p>The last section of the true antelopes is the <i>Bubalinae</i>,
represented by the hartebeest (<i>q.v.</i>), <i>Bubalis</i>, blesbok and sassaby
(<i>Damaliscus</i>), and the gnu (<i>q.v.</i>) or wildebeest (<i>Connochaetes</i>, also
called <i>Catoblepas</i>), all being African with the exception of one or
two hartebeests which range into Syria. All these are large and
generally more or less uniformly coloured antelopes with horns
in both sexes, long and more or less hairy tails, high withers,
small face-glands, naked muzzles, tall, narrow upper molars, and
the absence of pits in the frontal bones. The long face, high
crest for the horns, which are ringed, lyrate and more or less
strongly angulated, and the moderately long tail, are the
distinctive features of the hartebeests. They are large red
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page92" id="page92"></a>92</span>
antelopes (fig. 5), often with black markings on the face and limbs.
In <i>Damaliscus</i>, which includes, among many other species, the
blesbok and bontebok (<i>D. albifrons</i> and <i>D. pygargus</i>) and the
sassaby or bastard hartebeest (<i>D. lunatus</i>), the face is shorter,
and the horns straighter and set on a less elevated crest. The
colour, too, of these antelopes tends in many cases to purple,
with white markings. From the hartebeest the gnus (fig. 6)
differ by their smooth and outwardly or downwardly directed
horns, broad bristly muzzles, heavy manes and long horse-like
tails. There are two chief types, the white-tailed gnu or black
wildebeest (<i>Connochaetes gnu</i>) of South Africa, now nearly
extinct (fig. 6), and the brindled gnu, or blue wildebeest (<i>C.
taurinus</i>), which, with some local variation, has a large range in
South and East Africa.</p>

<p>In concluding this survey of living antelopes, reference may
be made to the subfamily <i>Rupicaprinae</i> (typified by the European
chamois), the members of which, as already stated, are in some
respects intermediate between antelopes and goats. They are
all small or medium-sized mountain ruminants, for the most part
European and Asiatic, but with one North American representative.
They are heavily built ruminants, with horns of
nearly equal size in both sexes, short tapering tails, large hoofs,
narrow goat-like upper molars, and usually small face-glands.
The horns are generally rather small, upright, ringed at the base,
and more or less curved backwards, but in the takin they are
gnu-like. The group is represented by the European chamois
or gemse (<i>Rupicapra tragus</i> or <i>R. rupicapra</i>), broadly distinguished by its well-known hook-like horns, and the Asiatic gorals
(<i>Urotragus</i>) and serows (<i>Nemorhaedus</i>), which are represented by
numerous species ranging from Tibet, the Himalaya, and China,
to the Malay Peninsula and islands, being in the two latter areas
the sole representatives of both antelopes and goats. In the
structure of its horns the North American white Rocky Mountain
goat (<i>Oreamnus</i>) is very like a serow, from which it differs by
its extremely short cannon-bones. In the latter respect this
ruminant resembles the takin (<i>Budorcas</i>) of Tibet, which, as
already mentioned, has horns recalling those of the white-tailed
gnu. Possibly the Arctic musk-ox (<i>Ovibos</i>) may be connected
with the takin by means of certain extinct ruminants, such as
the North American Pleistocene <i>Euceratherium</i> and the European
Pliocene <i>Criotherium</i> (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chamois</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Goral</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Serow</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Rocky
Mountain Goat</a></span> and <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Takin</a></span>).</p>

<p><i>Extinct Antelopes.</i>&mdash;Only a few lines can be devoted to extinct
antelopes, the earliest of which apparently date from the European
Miocene. An antelope from the Lower Pliocene of Northern
India known as <i>Bubalis</i>, or <i>Damaliscus, palaeindicus</i> indicates
the occurrence of the hartebeest group in that country. <i>Cobus</i> also occurs in the same formation, as does likewise <i>Hippotragus</i>.
<i>Palaeoryx</i> from the corresponding horizon in Greece and Samos
is to some extent intermediate between <i>Hippotragus</i> and <i>Oryx</i>.
Gazelles are common in the Miocene and Pliocene of both Europe
and Asia. Elands and kudus appear to have been represented
in India during the Pliocene; the European <i>Palaeoreas</i> of the
same age seems to be intermediate between the two, while
<i>Protragelaphus</i> is evidently another European representative of
the group. <i>Helicophora</i> is another spiral-horned European
Pliocene antelope, but of somewhat doubtful affinity; the same
being the case with the large <i>Criotherium</i> of the Samos Pliocene,
in which the short horns are curiously twisted. As already
stated, there is a possibility of this latter ruminant being allied
both to the takin and the musk-ox. <i>Palaeotragus</i> and <i>Tragoceros</i>,
of the Lower Pliocene of Greece, at one time regarded as antelopes, are now known to be ancestors of the okapi.</p>

Certainly it soon lost its independence, and in Strabo&rsquo;s time was
a mere village. The site is one of great strength, and is now
occupied by a fort, in the construction of which traces of the outer
walls and of huts, and several wells and a cistern, all belonging
to the primitive village, were discovered, and also the remains

<p><span class="bold">ANTEQUERA<a name="ar83" id="ar83"></a></span> (the ancient <i>Anticaria</i>), a town of southern
Spain, in the province of Málaga; on the Bobadilla-Granada
railway. Pop. (1900) 31,609. Antequera overlooks the fertile
valley bounded on the S. by the Sierra de los Torcales, and on
the N. by the river Guadalhorce. It occupies a commanding
position, while the remains of its walls, and of a fine Moorish
castle on a rock that overhangs the town, show how admirably
its natural defences were supplemented by art. Besides several
interesting churches and palaces, it contains a fine arch, erected
in 1595 in honour of Philip II., and partly constructed of inscribed
Roman masonry. In the eastern suburbs there is one of
the largest grave-mounds in Spain, said to be of prehistoric date,
and with subterranean chambers excavated to a depth of 65 ft.
The Peña de los Enamorados, or &ldquo;Lovers&rsquo; Peak,&rdquo; is a conspicuous
crag which owes its name to the romantic legend adapted by
Robert Southey (1774-1843) in his <i>Laila and Manuel</i>. Woollen
fabrics are manufactured, and the sugar industry established in
1890 employs several thousand hands; but the majority of the
inhabitants are occupied by the trade in grain, fruit, wine and
oil. Marble is quarried; and at El Torcal, 6 m. south, there is
a very curious labyrinth of red marble rocks. Antequera was
captured from the Moors in 1410, and became until 1492 one of
the most important outposts of the Christian power in Spain.</p>

<i>antefn</i>, a word which originally had the same meaning as antiphony (<i>q.v.</i>).
It is now, however, generally restricted to a form
of church music, particularly in the service of the Church of
England, in which it is appointed by the rubrics to follow the
third collect at both morning and evening prayer, &ldquo;in choirs and
places where they sing.&rdquo; It is just as usual in this place to have
an ordinary hymn as an anthem, which is a more elaborate
composition than the congregational hymns. Several anthems
are included in the English coronation service. The words are
selected from Holy Scripture or in some cases from the Liturgy,
and the music is generally more elaborate and varied than that
of psalm or hymn tunes. Anthems may be written for solo
voices only, for the full choir, or for both, and according to this
distinction are called respectively <i>Verse, Full</i>, and <i>Full with Verse</i>.
Though the anthem of the Church of England is analogous to the
<i>motet</i> of the Roman Catholic and Lutheran Churches, both being
written for a trained choir and not for the congregation, it is as
a musical form essentially English in its origin and development.
The English school of musicians has from the first devoted its
chief attention to this form, and scarcely a composer of any note
can be named who has not written several good anthems. Tallis,
Tye, Byrd, and Farrant in the 16th century; Orlando Gibbons,
Blow, and Purcell in the 17th, and Croft, Boyce, James Kent,
James Nares, Benjamin Cooke, and Samuel Arnold in the 18th
were famous composers of anthems, and in more recent times
the names are too numerous to mention.</p>

of the Ionic columns of the Erechtheum and its continuation as a
decorative frieze on the walls of the same, and (4) the cymatium

<p><span class="bold">ANTHEMIUS,<a name="ar88" id="ar88"></a></span> Greek mathematician and architect, who produced,
under the patronage of Justinian (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 532), the original
and daring plans for the church of St Sophia in Constantinople,
which strikingly displayed at once his knowledge and his ignorance.
He was one of five brothers&mdash;the sons of Stephanus, a
physician of Tralles&mdash;who were all more or less eminent in their
respective departments. Dioscorus followed his father&rsquo;s profession
in his native place; Alexander became at Rome one of the
most celebrated medical men of his time; Olympius was deeply
versed in Roman jurisprudence; and Metrodorus was one of the
distinguished grammarians of the great Eastern capital. It is
related of Anthemius that, having a quarrel with his next-door
neighbour Zeno, he annoyed him in two ways. First, he made a
number of leathern tubes the ends of which he contrived to fix
among the joists and flooring of a fine upper-room in which Zeno
entertained his friends, and then subjected it to a miniature
earthquake by sending steam through the tubes. Secondly, he
simulated thunder and lightning, the latter by flashing in Zeno&rsquo;s
eyes an intolerable light from a slightly hollowed mirror. Certain
it is that he wrote a treatise on burning-glasses. A fragment of
this was published under the title <span class="grk" title="Peri paradoxon maechonaematon">&#928;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#960;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#948;&#972;&#958;&#969;&#957; &#956;&#951;&#967;&#945;&#957;&#951;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#969;&#957;</span>
by L. Dupuy in 1777, and also appeared in 1786 in the forty-second
volume of the <i>Hist. de l&rsquo;Acad. des Inscr</i>.; A. Westermann
gave a revised edition of it in his <span class="grk" title="Paradoxographoi">&#928;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#948;&#959;&#958;&#959;&#947;&#961;&#940;&#966;&#959;&#953;</span> (<i>Scriptores
rerum mirabilium Graeci</i>), 1839. In the course of constructions
for surfaces to reflect to one and the same point (1) all rays in
whatever direction passing through another point, (2) a set of
parallel rays, Anthemius assumes a property of an ellipse not
found in Apollonius (the equality of the angles subtended at a
focus by two tangents drawn from a point), and (having given
the focus and a double ordinate) he uses the focus and directrix to
obtain any number of points on a parabola&mdash;the first instance on
record of the practical use of the directrix.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTHESTERIA,<a name="ar89" id="ar89"></a></span> one of the four Athenian festivals in honour
of Dionysus, held annually for three days (11th-13th) in the month
of Anthesterion (February-March). The object of the festival was
to celebrate the maturing of the wine stored at the previous
vintage, and the beginning of spring. On the first day, called
<i>Pithoigia</i> (opening of the casks), libations were offered from the
newly opened casks to the god of wine, all the household, including
servants and slaves, joining in the festivities. The rooms and
the drinking vessels in them were adorned with spring flowers, as
were also the children over three years of age. The second day,
named <i>Choës</i> (feast of beakers), was a time of merrymaking. The
people dressed themselves gaily, some in the disguise of the
mythical personages in the suite of Dionysus, and paid a round of
visits to their acquaintances. Drinking clubs met to drink off
matches, the winner being he who drained his cup most rapidly.
Others poured libations on the tombs of deceased relatives. On
the part of the state this day was the occasion of a peculiarly
solemn and secret ceremony in one of the sanctuaries of Dionysus
in the Lenaeum, which for the rest of the year was closed. The
basilissa (or basilinna), wife of the archon basileus for the time,
went through a ceremony of marriage to the wine god, in which
she was assisted by fourteen Athenian matrons, called <i>geraerae</i>,
chosen by the basileus and sworn to secrecy. The days on which
the Pithoigia and Choës were celebrated were both regarded as
<span class="grk" title="apophrades">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#966;&#961;&#940;&#948;&#949;&#962;</span> (<i>nefasti</i>) and <span class="grk" title="miarai">&#956;&#953;&#945;&#961;&#945;&#943;</span> (&ldquo;defiled&rdquo;), necessitating expiatory
libations; on them the souls of the dead came up from
the underworld and walked abroad; people chewed leaves of
whitethorn and besmeared their doors with tar to protect themselves
from evil. But at least in private circles the festive
character of the ceremonies predominated. The third day was
named <i>Chytri</i> (feast of pots, from <span class="grk" title="chytros">&#967;&#973;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>, a pot), a festival of the
dead. Cooked pulse was offered to Hermes, in his capacity of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page94" id="page94"></a>94</span>
god of the lower world, and to the souls of the dead. Although
no performances were allowed at the theatre, a sort of rehearsal
took place, at which the players for the ensuing dramatic festival
were selected.</p>

<p>The name Anthesteria, according to the account of it given
above, is usually connected with <span class="grk" title="anthos">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#959;&#962;</span> (&ldquo;flower,&rdquo; or the
&ldquo;bloom&rdquo; of the grape), but A.W. Verrall (<i>Journal of Hellenic
Studies</i>, xx., 1900, p. 115) explains it as a feast of &ldquo;revocation&rdquo;
(from <span class="grk" title="anathessasthai">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#952;&#941;&#963;&#963;&#945;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</span>, to &ldquo;pray back&rdquo; or &ldquo;up&rdquo;), at which the
ghosts of the dead were recalled to the land of the living (<i>cp.</i> the
Roman <i>mundus patet</i>). J.E. Harrison (<i>ibid</i>. 100, 109, and <i>Prolegomena</i>),
regarding the Anthesteria as primarily a festival of all
souls, the object of which was the expulsion of ancestral ghosts
by means of placation, explains <span class="grk" title="pithoigia">&#960;&#953;&#952;&#959;&#953;&#947;&#943;&#945;</span> as the feast of the
opening of the graves (<span class="grk" title="pithos">&#960;&#943;&#952;&#959;&#962;</span> meaning a large urn used for burial
purposes), <span class="grk" title="choes">&#967;&#972;&#949;&#962;</span> as the day of libations, and <span class="grk" title="chutroi">&#967;&#973;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#953;</span> as
the day of the grave-holes (not &ldquo;pots,&rdquo; which is <span class="grk" title="chutrai">&#967;&#973;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#953;</span>), in point of
time really anterior to the <span class="grk" title="pithoigia">&#960;&#953;&#952;&#959;&#953;&#947;&#943;&#945;</span>. E. Rohde and M.P. Nilsson,
however, take the <span class="grk" title="chutroi">&#967;&#973;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#953;</span> to mean &ldquo;water vessels,&rdquo; and connect
the ceremony with the Hydrophoria, a libation festival to propitiate
the dead who had perished in the flood of Deucalion.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTHIM THE IBERIAN,<a name="ar90" id="ar90"></a></span> a notable figure in the ecclesiastical
history of Rumania. A Georgian by birth, he came to Rumania
early in the second half of the 17th century, as a simple monk.
He became bishop of Râmnicu in 1705, and in 1708 archbishop
of Walachia. Taking a leading part in the political movements of
the time, he came into conflict with the newly appointed Greek
hospodars, and was exiled to Rumelia. But on his crossing the
Danube in 1716 he was thrown into the water and drowned,
as it is alleged, at the instigation of the prince of Walachia.
He was a man of great talents and spoke and wrote many
Oriental and European languages. Though a foreigner, he soon
acquired a thorough knowledge of Rumanian, and was instrumental
in helping to introduce that language into the church
as its official language. He was a master printer and an artist
of the first order. He cut the wood blocks for the books which
he printed in Tirgovishtea, Râmnicu, Snagov and Bucharest.
He was also the first to introduce Oriental founts of type into
Rumania, and he printed there the first Arabic missal for the
Christians of the East (Râmnicu, 1702). He also trained
Georgians in the art of printing, and cut the type with which
under his pupil Mihail Ishtvanovitch they printed the first
Georgian Gospels (Tiflis, 1709). A man of great oratorical
power, Anthim delivered a series of sermons (Didahii), and some
of his pastoral letters are models of style and of language as
well as of exact and beautiful printing. He also completed a
whole <i>corpus</i> of lectionaries, missals, gospels, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTHOLOGY.<a name="ar91" id="ar91"></a></span> The term &ldquo;anthology,&rdquo; literally denoting
a garland or collection of flowers, is figuratively applied to any
selection of literary beauties, and especially to that great body
of fugitive poetry, comprehending about 4500 pieces, by upwards
of 300 writers, which is commonly known as the <i>Greek Anthology</i>.</p>

<p><i>Literary History of the Greek Anthology.</i>&mdash;The art of occasional
poetry had been cultivated in Greece from an early period,&mdash;less,
however, as the vehicle of personal feeling, than as the
recognized commemoration of remarkable individuals or events,
on sepulchral monuments and votive offerings: Such compositions
were termed epigrams, <i>i.e.</i> inscriptions. The modern
use of the word is a departure from the original sense, which
simply indicated that the composition was intended to be engraved
or inscribed. Such a composition must necessarily be
brief, and the restraints attendant upon its publication concurred
with the simplicity of Greek taste in prescribing conciseness of
expression, pregnancy of meaning, purity of diction and singleness
of thought, as the indispensable conditions of excellence
in the epigrammatic style. The term was soon extended to
any piece by which these conditions were fulfilled. The transition
from the monumental to the purely literary character of the
epigram was favoured by the exhaustion of more lofty forms of
poetry, the general increase, from the general diffusion of culture,
of accomplished writers and tasteful readers, but, above all,
by the changed political circumstances of the times, which induced
many who would otherwise have engaged in public affairs
to addict themselves to literary pursuits. These causes came
into full operation during the Alexandrian era, in which we
find every description of epigrammatic composition perfectly
developed. About 60 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, the sophist and poet, Meleager of
Gadara, undertook to combine the choicest effusions of his
predecessors into a single body of fugitive poetry. Collections
of monumental inscriptions, or of poems on particular subjects,
had previously been formed by Polemon Periegetes and others;
but Meleager first gave the principle a comprehensive application.
His selection, compiled from forty-six of his predecessors, and
including numerous contributions of his own, was entitled
<i>The Garland</i> (<span class="grk" title="Stephanos">&#931;&#964;&#941;&#966;&#945;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>); and in an introductory poem each poet is compared to some flower, fancifully deemed appropriate to
his genius. The arrangement of his collection was alphabetical,
according to the initial letter of each epigram.</p>

<p>In the age of the emperor Tiberius (or Trajan, according to
others) the work of Meleager was continued by another epigrammatist,
Philippus of Thessalonica, who first employed the term
anthology. His collection, which included the compositions of
thirteen writers subsequent to Meleager, was also arranged
alphabetically, and contained an introductory poem. It was of
inferior quality to Meleager&rsquo;s. Somewhat later, under Hadrian,
another supplement was formed by the sophist Diogenianus
of Heracleia (2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>), and Strato of Sardis compiled
his elegant but tainted <span class="grk" title="Mousa Paidikê">&#924;&#959;&#8166;&#963;&#945; &#928;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#953;&#954;&#942;</span> (Musa Puerilis) from
his productions and those of earlier writers. No further collection
from various sources is recorded until the time of Justinian,
when epigrammatic writing, especially of an amatory character,
experienced a great revival at the hands of Agathias of Myrina,
the historian, Paulus Silentiarius, and their circle. Their ingenious
but mannered productions were collected by Agathias
into a new anthology, entitled <i>The Circle</i> (<span class="grk" title="Kyklos">&#922;&#973;&#954;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>); it was the
first to be divided into books, and arranged with reference to
the subjects of the pieces.</p>

<p>These and other collections made during the middle ages are
now lost. The partial incorporation of them into a single body,
classified according to the contents in 15 books, was the work
of a certain Constantinus Cephalas, whose name alone is preserved
in the single MS. of his compilation extant, but who probably
lived during the temporary revival of letters under Constantine
Porphyrogenitus, at the beginning of the 10th century. He
appears to have merely made excerpts from the existing anthologies,
with the addition of selections from Lucillius, Palladas,
and other epigrammatists, whose compositions had been published
separately. His arrangement, to which we shall have to recur,
is founded on a principle of classification, and nearly corresponds
to that adopted by Agathias. His principle of selection is unknown;
it is only certain that while he omitted much that he
should have retained, he has preserved much that would otherwise
have perished. The extent of our obligations may be ascertained
by a comparison between his anthology and that of the
next editor, the monk Maximus Planudes (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1320), who has
not merely grievously mutilated the anthology of Cephalas by
omissions, but has disfigured it by interpolating verses of his
own. We are, however, indebted to him for the preservation
of the epigrams on works of art, which seem to have been
accidentally omitted from our only transcript of Cephalas.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Planudean (in seven books) was the only recension of the
anthology known at the revival of classical literature, and was first
published at Florence, by Janus Lascaris, in 1494. It long continued
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>95</span>
to be the only accessible collection, for although the Palatine MS.,
the sole extant copy of the anthology of Cephalas, was discovered
in the Palatine library at Heidelberg, and copied by Saumaise
(Salmasius) in 1606, it was not published until 1776, when it was
included in Brunck&rsquo;s <i>Analecta Veterum Poetarum Graecorum</i>. The
MS. itself had frequently changed its quarters. In 1623, having
been taken in the sack of Heidelberg in the Thirty Years&rsquo; War, it
was sent with the rest of the Palatine Library to Rome as a present
from Maximilian I. of Bavaria to Gregory XV., who had it divided
into two parts, the first of which was by far the larger; thence it
was taken to Paris in 1797. In 1816 it went back to Heidelberg, but
in an incomplete state, the second part remaining at Paris. It is
now represented at Heidelberg by a photographic facsimile. Brunck&rsquo;s
edition was superseded by the standard one of Friedrich Jacobs
(1794-1814, 13 vols.), the text of which was reprinted in a more
convenient form in 1813-1817, and occupies three pocket volumes in
the Tauchnitz series of the classics. The best edition for general
purposes is perhaps that of Dubner in Didot&rsquo;s <i>Bibliotheca</i> (1864-1872),
which contains the Palatine Anthology, the epigrams of the
Planudean Anthology not comprised in the former, an appendix of
pieces derived from other sources, copious notes selected from all
quarters, a literal Latin prose translation by Boissonade, Bothe, and
Lapaume and the metrical Latin versions of Hugo Grotius. A third
volume, edited by E. Cougny, was published in 1890. The best
edition of the Planudean Anthology is the splendid one by van
Bosch and van Lennep (1795-1822). There is also a complete
edition of the text by Stadlmuller in the Teubner series.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Arrangement.</i>&mdash;The Palatine MS., the archetype of the present
text, was transcribed by different persons at different times,
and the actual arrangement of the collection does not correspond
with that signalized in the index. It is as follows: Book 1.
Christian epigrams; 2. Christodorus&rsquo;s description of certain
statues; 3. Inscriptions in the temple at Cyzicus; 4. The prefaces
of Meleager, Philippus, and Agathias to their respective
collections; 5. Amatory epigrams; 6. Votive inscriptions;
7. Epitaphs; 8. The epigrams of Gregory of Nazianzus; 9.
Rhetorical and illustrative epigrams; 10. Ethical pieces; 11.
Humorous and convivial; 12. Strata&rsquo;s Musa Puerilis; 13.
Metrical curiosities; 14. Puzzles, enigmas, oracles; 15. Miscellanies.
The epigrams on works of art, as already stated, are
missing from the <i>Codex Palatinus</i>, and must be sought in an
appendix of epigrams only occurring in the Planudean Anthology.
The epigrams hitherto recovered from ancient monuments and
similar sources form appendices in the second and third volumes
of Dübner&rsquo;s edition.</p>

<p><i>Style and Value.</i>&mdash;One of the principal claims of the Anthology
to attention is derived from its continuity, its existence as a
living and growing body of poetry throughout all the vicissitudes
of Greek civilization. More ambitious descriptions of composition
speedily ran their course, and having attained their
complete development became extinct or at best lingered only
in feeble or conventional imitations. The humbler strains of the
epigrammatic muse, on the other hand, remained ever fresh and
animated, ever in intimate union with the spirit of the generation
that gave them birth. To peruse the entire collection, accordingly,
is as it were to assist at the disinterment of an ancient city,
where generation has succeeded generation on the same site, and
each stratum of soil enshrines the vestiges of a distinct epoch, but
where all epochs, nevertheless, combine to constitute an organic
whole, and the transition from one to the other is hardly perceptible.
Four stages may be indicated:&mdash;1. The Hellenic proper, of
which Simonides of Ceos (<i>c.</i> 556-469 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), the author of most of
the sepulchral inscriptions on those who fell in the Persian wars,
is the characteristic representative. This is characterized by a
simple dignity of phrase, which to a modern taste almost verges
upon baldness, by a crystalline transparency of diction, and by
an absolute fidelity to the original conception of the epigram.
Nearly all the pieces of this era are actual <i>bona fide</i> inscriptions
or addresses to real personages, whether living or deceased;
narratives, literary exercises, and sports of fancy are exceedingly
rare. 2. The epigram received a great development in its second
or Alexandrian era, when its range was so extended as to include
anecdote, satire, and amorous longing; when epitaphs and votive
inscriptions were composed on imaginary persons and things,
and men of taste successfully attempted the same subjects in
mutual emulation, or sat down to compose verses as displays of
their ingenuity. The result was a great gain in richness of style
and general interest, counterbalanced by a falling off in purity of
diction and sincerity of treatment. The modification&mdash;a perfectly
legitimate one, the resources of the old style being exhausted&mdash;had
its real source in the transformation of political life, but may
be said to commence with and to find its best representative in
the playful and elegant Leonidas of Tarentum, a contemporary
of Pyrrhus, and to close with Antipater of Sidon, about 140 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
(or later). It should be noticed, however, that Callimachus, one
of the most distinguished of the Alexandrian poets, affects the
sternest simplicity in his epigrams, and copies the austerity of
Simonides with as much success as an imitator can expect.
3. By a slight additional modification in the same direction, the
Alexandrian passes into what, for the sake of preserving the
parallelism with eras of Greek prose literature, we may call
the Roman style, although the peculiarities of its principal
representative are decidedly Oriental. Meleager of Gadara was a
Syrian; his taste was less severe, and his temperament more
fervent than those of his Greek predecessors; his pieces are
usually erotic, and their glowing imagery sometimes reminds us of
the Song of Solomon. The luxuriance of his fancy occasionally
betrays him into far-fetched conceits, and the lavishness of his
epithets is only redeemed by their exquisite felicity. Yet his
effusions are manifestly the offspring of genuine feeling, and his
epitaph on himself indicates a great advance on the exclusiveness
of antique Greek patriotism, and is perhaps the first clear
enunciation of the spirit of universal humanity characteristic
of the later Stoic philosophy. His gaiety and licentiousness
are imitated and exaggerated by his somewhat later contemporary,
the Epicurean Philodemus, perhaps the liveliest of all
the epigrammatists; his fancy reappears with diminished
brilliancy in Philodemus&rsquo;s contemporary, Zonas, in Crinagoras,
who wrote under Augustus, and in Marcus Argentarius, of uncertain
date; his peculiar gorgeousness of colouring remains
entirely his own. At a later period of the empire another
<i>genre</i>, hitherto comparatively in abeyance, was developed, the
satirical. Lucillius, who flourished under Nero, and Lucian, more
renowned in other fields of literature, display a remarkable
talent for shrewd, caustic epigram, frequently embodying moral
reflexions of great cogency, often lashing vice and folly with
signal effect, but not seldom indulging in mere trivialities, or
deformed by scoffs at personal blemishes. This style of composition
is not properly Greek, but Roman; it answers to the
modern definition of epigram, and has hence attained a celebrity
in excess of its deserts. It is remarkable, however, as an almost
solitary example of direct Latin influence on Greek literature.
The same style obtains with Palladas, an Alexandrian grammarian
of the 4th century, the last of the strictly classical epigrammatists,
and the first to be guilty of downright bad taste.
His better pieces, however, are characterized by an austere
ethical impressiveness, and his literary position is very interesting
as that of an indignant but despairing opponent of Christianity.
4. The fourth or Byzantine style of epigrammatic composition
was cultivated by the <i>beaux-esprits</i> of the court of Justinian. To
a great extent this is merely imitative, but the circumstances
of the period operated so as to produce a species of originality.
The peculiarly ornate and <i>recherché</i> diction of Agathias and his
compeers is not a merit in itself, but, applied for the first time,
it has the effect of revivifying an old form, and many of their
new locutions are actual enrichments of the language. The
writers, moreover, were men of genuine poetical feeling, ingenious
in invention, and capable of expressing emotion with energy
and liveliness; the colouring of their pieces is sometimes highly
dramatic.</p>

<p>It would be hard to exaggerate the substantial value of the
Anthology, whether as a storehouse of facts bearing on antique
manners, customs and ideas, or as one among the influences
which have contributed to mould the literature of the modern
world. The multitudinous votive inscriptions, serious and
sportive, connote the phases of Greek religious sentiment, from
pious awe to irreverent familiarity and sarcastic scepticism; the
moral tone of the nation at various periods is mirrored with corresponding
fidelity; the sepulchral inscriptions admit us into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page96" id="page96"></a>96</span>
the inmost sanctuary of family affection, and reveal a depth and
tenderness of feeling beyond the province of the historian to
depict, which we should not have surmised even from the
dramatists; the general tendency of the collection is to display
antiquity on its most human side, and to mitigate those contrasts
with the modern world which more ambitious modes of composition
force into relief. The constant reference to the details
of private life renders the Anthology an inexhaustible treasury
for the student of archaeology; art, industry and costume
receive their fullest illustration from its pages. Its influence on
European literatures will be appreciated in proportion to the
inquirer&rsquo;s knowledge of each. The further his researches extend,
the greater will be his astonishment at the extent to which the
Anthology has been laid under contribution for thoughts which
have become household words in all cultivated languages, and at
the beneficial effect of the imitation of its brevity, simplicity,
and absolute verbal accuracy upon the undisciplined luxuriance
of modern genius.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><i>Translations, Imitations, &amp;c.</i>&mdash;The best versions of the Anthology
ever made are the Latin renderings of select epigrams by Hugo
Grotius. They have not been printed separately, but will be found
in Bosch and Lennep&rsquo;s edition of the Planudean <i>Anthology</i>, in the
Didot edition, and in Dr Wellesley&rsquo;s <i>Anthologia Polyglotta</i>. The
number of more or less professed imitations in modern languages
is infinite, that of actual translations less considerable. French and
Italian, indeed, are ill adapted to this purpose, from their incapacity
of approximating to the form of the original, and their poets have
usually contented themselves with paraphrases or imitations, often
exceedingly felicitous. F.D. Dehèque&rsquo;s French prose translation,
however (1863), is most excellent and valuable. The German
language alone admits of the preservation of the original metre&mdash;a
circumstance advantageous to the German translators, Herder and
Jacobs, who have not, however, compensated the loss inevitably
consequent upon a change of idiom by any added beauties of their
own. Though unfitted to reproduce the precise form, the English
language, from its superior terseness, is better adapted to preserve
the spirit of the original than the German; and the comparative
ill success of many English translators must be chiefly attributed to
the extremely low standard of fidelity and brevity observed by
them. Bland, Merivale, and their associates (1806-1813), are often
intolerably diffuse and feeble, from want, not of ability, but of
taking pains. Archdeacon Wrangham&rsquo;s too rare versions are much
more spirited; and John Sterling&rsquo;s translations of the inscriptions
of Simonides deserve high praise. Professor Wilson (<i>Blackwood&rsquo;s
Magazine</i>, 1833-1835) collected and commented upon the labours of
these and other translators, with his accustomed critical insight and
exuberant geniality, but damaged his essay by burdening it with
the indifferent attempts of William Hay. In 1849 Dr Wellesley,
principal of New Inn Hall, Oxford, published his <i>Anthologia Polyglotta</i>,
a most valuable collection of the best translations and imitations
in all languages, with the original text. In this appeared some
admirable versions by Goldwin Smith and Dean Merivale, which,
with the other English renderings extant at the time, will be found
accompanying the literal prose translation of the <i>Public School
Selections</i>, executed by the Rev. George Burges for Bohn&rsquo;s Classical
Library (1854). This is a useful volume, but the editor&rsquo;s notes are
worthless. In 1864 Major R.G. Macgregor published an almost
complete translation of the Anthology, a work whose stupendous
industry and fidelity almost redeem the general mediocrity of the
execution. <i>Idylls and Epigrams</i>, by R. Garnett (1869, reprinted
1892 in the Cameo series), includes about 140 translations or imitations,
with some original compositions in the same style. Recent
translations (selections) are: J.W. Mackail, <i>Select Epigrams from
the Greek Anthology</i> (with text, introduction, notes, and prose
translation), 1890, revised 1906, a most charming volume; Graham
R. Tomson (Mrs Marriott Watson), <i>Selections from the Greek
Anthology</i> (1889); W.H.D. Rouse, <i>Echo of Greek Song</i> (1899);
L.C. Perry, <i>From the Garden of Hellas</i> (New York, 1891); W.R.
Paton, <i>Love Epigrams</i> (1898). An agreeable little volume on the
Anthology, by Lord Neaves, is one of Collins&rsquo;s series of <i>Ancient
Classics for Modern Readers</i>. The earl of Cromer, with all the cares
of Egyptian administration upon him, found time to translate and
publish an elegant volume of selections (1903). Two critical contributions
to the subject should be noticed, the Rev. James Davies&rsquo;s
essay on Epigrams in the <i>Quarterly Review</i> (vol. cxvii.), especially
valuable for its lucid illustration of the distinction between Greek
and Latin epigram; and the brilliant disquisition in J.A. Symonds&rsquo;s
<i>Studies of the Greek Poets</i> (1873; 3rd ed., 1893).</p>
</div>

<p><i>Latin Anthology.</i>&mdash;The <i>Latin Anthology</i> is the appellation
bestowed upon a collection of fugitive Latin verse, from the age
of Ennius to about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 1000, formed by Peter Burmann the
Younger. Nothing corresponding to the Greek anthology is
known to have existed among the Romans, though professional
epigrammatists like Martial published their volumes on their
own account, and detached sayings were excerpted from authors
like Ennius and Publius Syrus, while the <i>Priapeïa</i> were probably
but one among many collections on special subjects. The first
general collection of scattered pieces made by a modern scholar
was Scaliger&rsquo;s <i>Catalecta veterum Poetarum</i> (1573), succeeded by
the more ample one of Pithoeus, <i>Epigrammata et Poemata e
Codicibus et Lapidibus collecta</i> (1590). Numerous additions,
principally from inscriptions, continued to be made, and in
1759-1773 Burmann digested the whole into his <i>Anthologia
veterum Latinorum Epigrammatum et Poematum</i>. This, occasionally
reprinted, was the standard edition until 1869, when
Alexander Riese commenced a new and more critical recension,
from which many pieces improperly inserted by Burmann are
rejected, and his classified arrangement is discarded for one
according to the sources whence the poems have been derived.
The first volume contains those found in MSS., in the order of
the importance of these documents; those furnished by inscriptions
following. The first volume (in two parts) appeared in
1869-1870, a second edition of the first part in 1894, and the
second volume, <i>Carmina Epigraphica</i> (in two parts), in 1895-1897,
edited by F. Bücheler. An <i>Anthologiae Latinae Supplementa</i>,
in the same series, followed. Having been formed by
scholars actuated by no aesthetic principles of selection, but
solely intent on preserving everything they could find, the Latin
anthology is much more heterogeneous than the Greek, and
unspeakably inferior. The really beautiful poems of Petronius
and Apuleius are more properly inserted in the collected editions
of their writings, and more than half the remainder consists of
the frigid conceits of pedantic professional exercises of grammarians
of a very late period of the empire, relieved by an
occasional gem, such as the apostrophe of the dying Hadrian to
his spirit, or the epithalamium of Gallienus. The collection is
also, for the most part, too recent in date, and too exclusively
literary in character, to add much to our knowledge of classical
antiquity. The epitaphs are interesting, but the genuineness of
many of them is very questionable.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTHON, CHARLES<a name="ar92" id="ar92"></a></span> (1797-1867), American classical scholar,
was born in New York city on the 19th of November 1797.
After graduating with honours at Columbia College in 1815, he
began the study of law, and in 1819 was admitted to the bar,
but never practised. In 1820 he was appointed assistant professor
of Greek and Latin in his old college, full professor ten
years later, and at the same time headmaster of the grammar
school attached to the college, which post he held until 1864.
He died at New York on the 29th of July 1867. He produced
for use in colleges and schools a large number of classical works,
which enjoyed great popularity, although his editions of classical
authors were by no means in favour with schoolmasters, owing to
the large amount of assistance, especially translations, contained
in the notes.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANTHONY, SAINT,<a name="ar93" id="ar93"></a></span> the first Christian monk, was born in
Egypt about 250. At the age of twenty he began to practise an
ascetical life in the neighbourhood of his native place, and after
fifteen years of this life he withdrew into solitude to a mountain
by the Nile, called Pispir, now Der el Memun, opposite Arsinoë
in the Fayum. Here he lived strictly enclosed in an old fort for
twenty years. At last in the early years of the 4th century he
emerged from his retreat and set himself to organize the monastic
life of the crowds of monks who had followed him and taken up
their abode in the caves around him. After a time, again in
pursuit of more complete solitude, he withdrew to the mountain
by the Red Sea, where now stands the monastery that bears his
name (Der Mar Antonios). Here he died about the middle of
the 4th century. His <i>Life</i> states that on two occasions he went
to Alexandria, to strengthen the Christians in the Diocletian
persecution and to preach against Arianism. Anthony is
recognized as the first Christian monk and the first organizer
and father of Christian monachism (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Monasticism</a></span>). Certain
letters and sermons are attributed to him, but their authenticity
is more than doubtful. The monastic rule which bears his name
was not written by him, but was compiled out of these writings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page97" id="page97"></a>97</span>
and out of discourses and utterances put into his mouth in the
<i>Life</i> and the <i>Apophthegmata Patrum</i>. According to this rule
live a number of Coptic Syrian and Armenian monks to this day.
The chief source of information about St Anthony is the <i>Life</i>,
attributed to St Athanasius. This attribution, as also the
historical character of the book, and even the very existence of
St Anthony, were questioned and denied by the sceptical criticism
of thirty years ago; but such doubts are no longer entertained
by critical scholars.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>The Greek <i>Vita</i> is among the works of St Athanasius; the almost
contemporary Latin translation is among Rosweyd&rsquo;s <i>Vitae Patrum</i>

volume of the &ldquo;Nicene and Post-Nicene Library.&rdquo; Accounts
of St Anthony are given by Card. Newman, <i>Church of the Fathers</i>

<p><span class="bold">ANTHONY OF PADUA, SAINT<a name="ar94" id="ar94"></a></span> (1195-1231), the most celebrated
of the followers of Saint Francis of Assisi, was born at
Lisbon on the 15th of August 1195. In his fifteenth year he entered
the Augustinian order, and subsequently joined the Franciscans
in 1220. He wished to devote himself to missionary labours in
North Africa, but the ship in which he sailed was cast by a storm
on the coast of Sicily, whence he made his way to Italy. He
taught theology at Bologna, Toulouse, Montpellier and Padua,
and won a great reputation as a preacher throughout Italy. He
was the leader of the rigorous party in the Franciscan order
against the mitigations introduced by the general Elias. His
death took place at the convent of Ara Coeli, near Padua, on the
13th of June 1231. He was canonized by Gregory IX. in the
following year, and his festival is kept on the 13th of June. He
is regarded as the patron saint of Padua and of Portugal, and
is appealed to by devout clients for finding lost objects. The
meagre accounts of his life which we possess have been supplemented
by numerous popular legends, which represent him
as a continuous worker of miracles, and describe his marvellous
eloquence by pictures of fishes leaping out of the water to
hear him. There are many confraternities established in his
honour throughout Christendom, and the number of &ldquo;pious&rdquo;
biographies devoted to him would fill many volumes.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTHONY, SUSAN BROWNELL<a name="ar95" id="ar95"></a></span> (1820-1906), American
reformer, was born at Adams, Massachusetts, on the 15th of
February 1820, the daughter of Quakers. Soon after her birth,
her family moved to the state of New York, and after 1845 she
lived in Rochester. She received her early education in a school
maintained by her father for his own and neighbours&rsquo; children,
and from the time she was seventeen until she was thirty-two
she taught in various schools. In the decade preceding the
outbreak of the Civil War she took a prominent part in the
anti-slavery and temperance movements in New York, organizing
in 1852 the first woman&rsquo;s state temperance society in America, and
in 1856 becoming the agent for New York state of the American
Anti-slavery Society. After 1854 she devoted herself almost
exclusively to the agitation for woman&rsquo;s rights, and became
recognized as one of the ablest and most zealous advocates,
both as a public speaker and as a writer, of the complete legal
equality of the two sexes. From 1868 to 1870 she was the
proprietor of a weekly paper, <i>The Revolution</i>, published in New
York, edited by Mrs Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and having for
its motto, &ldquo;The true republic&mdash;men, their rights and nothing
more; women, their rights and nothing less.&rdquo; She was vice-president-at-large
of the National Woman&rsquo;s Suffrage Association
from the date of its organization in 1869 until 1892, when she
became president. For casting a vote in the presidential election
of 1872, as, she asserted, the Fourteenth Amendment to the
Federal Constitution entitled her to do, she was arrested and
fined $100, but she never paid the fine. In collaboration with
Mrs Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Mrs Matilda Joslyn Gage, and Mrs

<p><span class="bold">ANTHOZOA<a name="ar96" id="ar96"></a></span> (<i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;flower-animals&rdquo;), the zoological name
for a class of marine polyps forming &ldquo;coral&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>). Although
corals have been familiar objects since the days of antiquity,
and the variety known as the precious red coral has been for a
long time an article of commerce in the Mediterranean, it was only
in the 18th century that their true nature and structure came to
be understood. By the ancients and the earlier naturalists
of the Christian era they were regarded either as petrifactions or
as plants, and many supposed that they occupied a position
midway between minerals and plants. The discovery of the
animal nature of red coral is due to J.A. de Peyssonel, a native
of Marseilles, who obtained living specimens from the coral
fishers on the coast of Barbary and kept them alive in aquaria.
He was thus able to see that the so-called &ldquo;flowers of coral&rdquo;
were in fact nothing else than minute polyps resembling sea-anemones.
His discovery, made in 1727, was rejected by the
Academy of Sciences of France, but eventually found acceptance
at the hands of the Royal Society of London, and was published
by that body in 1751. The structure and classification of polyps,
however, were at that time very imperfectly understood, and
it was fully a century before the true anatomical characters
and systematic position of corals were placed on a secure basis.</p>

<p>The hard calcareous substance to which the name coral is
applied is the supporting skeleton of certain members of the
<i>Anthozoa</i>, one of the classes of the phylum Coelentera. The most
familiar Anthozoan is the common sea-anemone, <i>Actinia equina</i>,
L., and it will serve, although it does not form a skeleton or
<i>corallum</i>, as a good example of the structure of a typical Anthozoan
polyp or zooid. The individual animal or zooid of <i>Actinia
equina</i> has the form of a column fixed by one extremity, called
the <i>base</i>, to a rock or other object, and bearing at the opposite
extremity a crown of <i>tentacles</i>. The tentacles surround an area
known as the <i>peristome</i>, in the middle of which there is an
elongated mouth-opening surrounded by tumid lips. The mouth
does not open directly into the general cavity of the body, as
is the case in a hydrozoan polyp, but into a short tube called
the <i>stomodaeum</i>, which in its turn opens below into the general
body-cavity or <i>coelenteron</i>. In Actinia and its allies, and most
generally, though not invariably, in Anthozoa, the stomodaeum
is not circular, but is compressed from side to side so as to be
oval or slit-like in transverse section. At each end of the oval
there is a groove lined by specially long vibratile cilia. These
grooves are known as the <i>sulcus</i> and <i>sulculus</i>, and will be more
particularly described hereafter. The elongation of the mouth
and stomodaeum confer a bilateral symmetry on the body of the
zooid, which is extended to other organs of the body. In Actinia,
as in all Anthozoan zooids, the coelenteron is not a simple cavity,
as in a Hydroid, but is divided by a number of radial folds or
curtains of soft tissue into a corresponding number of radial
chambers. These radial folds are known as <i>mesenteries</i>, and
their position and relations may be understood by reference
to figs. 1 and 2. Each mesentery is attached by its upper
margin to the peristome, by its outer margin to the body-wall,
and by its lower margin to the basal disk. A certain number of
mesenteries, known as complete mesenteries, are attached by
the upper parts of their internal margins to the stomodaeum,
but below this level their edges hang in the coelenteron. Other
mesenteries, called incomplete, are not attached to the stomodaeum,
and their internal margins are free from the peristome
to the basal disk. The lower part of the free edge of every
mesentery, whether complete or incomplete, is thrown into
numerous puckers or folds, and is furnished with a glandular
thickening known as a <i>mesenterial filament</i>. The reproductive
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page98" id="page98"></a>98</span>
organs or gonads are borne on the mesenteries, the germinal
cells being derived from the inner layer or endoderm.</p>

<p>In common with all Coelenterate animals, the walls of the
columnar body and also the tentacles and peristome of Actinia
are composed of three layers of tissue. The external layer,
or ectoderm, is made up of cells, and contains also muscular and nervous elements. The preponderating elements of the ectodermic layer are elongated columnar cells, each containing a
nucleus, and bearing cilia at their free extremities.
Packed in among these are <i>gland cells, sense cells</i>, and
<i>cnidoblasts</i>. The last-named are specially numerous on the tentacles and on some other regions of the body, and
produce the well-known &ldquo;thread cells,&rdquo; or
<i>nematocysts</i>, so characteristic of the Coelentera.
The inner layer or endoderm is also a cellular layer, and is chiefly made up of columnar cells, each bearing a cilium at its free extremity and terminating internally in a long muscular fibre. Such cells, made up of epithelial and muscular components, are known as epithelio-muscular or myo-epithelial
cells. In Actinians the
epithelio-muscular cells of
the endoderm are crowded
with yellow spherical
bodies, which are unicellular
plants or Algae, living
symbiotically in the
tissues of the zooid. The
endoderm contains in
addition gland cells and
nervous elements. The
middle layer or mesogloea
is not originally a cellular
layer, but a gelatinoid
structureless substance,
secreted by the two cellular
layers. In the course of
development, however,
cells from the ectoderm
and endoderm may migrate
into it. In <i>Actinia
equina</i> the mesogloea consists
of fine fibres imbedded
in a homogeneous matrix,
and between the fibres
are minute branched or
spindle-shaped cells. For
further details of the
structure of Actinians,
the reader should consult
the work of O. and R.
Hertwig.</p>

<p>The Anthozoa are divisible into two sub-classes, sharply marked off from one another
by definite anatomical characters. These are the <span class="sc">Alcyonaria</span>
and the <span class="sc">Zoantharia</span>. To the first-named belong the precious
red coral and its allies, the sea-fans or Gorgoniae, to the
second belong the white or Madreporarian corals.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Alcyonaria.&mdash;In this sub-class the zooid
has very constant anatomical characters, differing in some important respects from the
Actinian zooid, which has been taken as a type. There is only one
ciliated groove, the sulcus, in the stomodaeum. There are always
eight tentacles, which are hollow and fringed on their sides, with
hollow projections or pinnae; and always eight mesenteries, all of
which are complete, <i>i.e.</i> inserted on the stomodaeum. The mesenteries
are provided with well-developed longitudinal retractor
muscles, supported on longitudinal folds or plaits of the mesogloea,
so that in cross-section they have a branched appearance. These
<i>muscle-banners</i>, as they
are called, have a
highly characteristic
arrangement; they are
all situated on those
faces of the mesenteries
which look towards the
sulcus. (fig. 4).
Each mesentery has a filament;
but two of them,
namely, the pair
farthest from the sulcus,
are longer than the
rest, and have a different
form of filament.
It has been shown that
these asulcar filaments
are derived from the
ectoderm, the remainder
from the endoderm.
The only
exceptions to this
structure are found in
the arrested or modified
zooids, which occur in
many of the colonial
Alcyonaria. In these
the tentacles are
stunted or suppressed and the
mesenteries are
ill-developed, but the
sulcus is unusually large and has long cilia. Such modified zooids are
called siphonozooids, their function being to drive currents of fluid
through the canal-systems of the colonies to which they belong.
With very few exceptions a calcareous skeleton is present in all
Alcyonaria; it usually consists of spicules of carbonate of lime, each
spicule being formed within an ectodermic cell (fig. 3, B). Most
commonly the spicule-forming cells pass out of the ectoderm and are
imbedded in the mesogloea, where they may remain separate from
one another or may be fused together to form a strong mass. In
addition to the spicular skeleton an organic horny skeleton is frequently
present, either in
the form of a horny external
investment (<i>Cornularia</i>),
or an internal
axis (<i>Gorgonia</i>), or it may
form a matrix in which
spicules are imbedded
(<i>Keroeides, Meistodes</i>).</p>

<p>Nearly all the Alcyonaria
are colonial. Four solitary
species have been described,
viz. <i>Haimea
funebris</i> and <i>H. hyalina,
Hartea elegans</i>, and <i>Monoxenia
Darwinii</i>; but it is
doubtful whether these are
not the young forms of
colonies. For the present
the solitary forms may be
placed in a grade, <i>Protal-cyonacea</i>,
and the colonial
forms may be grouped in
another grade, <i>Synalcyonacea</i>.
Every Alcyonarian
colony is developed by
budding from a single
parent zooid. The buds
are not direct outgrowths
of the body-wall, but are formed on the courses of hollow out
growths of the base or body-wall, called <i>solenia</i>. These form a
more or less complicated canal system, lined by endoderm, and
communicating with the cavities of the zooids. The most simple
form of budding is found in the genus <i>Cornularia</i>, in which the
mother zooid gives off from its base one or more simple radiciform
outgrowths. Each outgrowth contains a single tube or solenium,
and at a longer or shorter distance from the mother zooid a
daughter zooid is formed as a bud. This gives off new outgrowths,
and these, branching and anastomosing with one another, may form
a network, adhering to stones, corals, or other objects, from which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page99" id="page99"></a>99</span>
zooids arise at intervals. In <i>Clavularia</i> and its allies each outgrowth
contains several solenia, and the outgrowths may take the form of
flat expansions, composed of a number of solenial tubes felted
together to form a lamellar surface of attachment. Such outgrowths
are called <i>stolons</i>, and a stolon may be simple, <i>i.e.</i> contain only one
solenium, as in <i>Cornularia</i>, or may be complex and built up of many
solenia, as in <i>Clavularia</i>. Further complications arise when the
lower walls of the mother zooid become thickened and interpenetrated
with solenia, from which buds are developed, so that lobose,
tufted, or branched colonies
are formed. The chief orders
of the Synalcyonacea are
founded upon the different
architectural features of
colonies produced by different
modes of budding. We
recognize six orders&mdash;the
<span class="sc">Stolonifera, Alcyonacea,
Pseudaxonia, Axifera,
Stelechotokea</span>, and
<span class="sc">Cornothecalia</span>.</p>

<p>In the order <span class="sc">Stolonirera</span>
the zooids spring at intervals
from branching or lamellar
stolons, and are usually free
from one another, except at
their bases, but in some cases
horizontal solenia arising
at various heights from
the body-wall may place
the more distal portions
of the zooids in communication
with one another.
In the genus <i>Tubipora</i> these
horizontal solenia unite to
form a series of horizontal
platforms (fig. 5). The order
comprises the families <i>Cornulamdae,
Syringopordae,
Tubipondae</i>, and
<i>Favositidae</i>. In the first-named,
the zooids are united only by
their bases and the skeleton
consists of loose spicules. In the <i>Tubipondae</i> the spicules of the
proximal part of the body-wall are fused together to form a firm
tube, the corallite, into which the distal part of the zooid can be
retracted. The corallites are connected at intervals by horizontal
platforms containing solenia, and at the level of each platform the
cavity of the corallite is divided by a transverse calcareous partition,
either flat or cup-shaped, called a <i>tabula</i>. Formerly all corals in
which tabulae are present were classed together as Tabulata, but
Tubipora is an undoubted Alcyonarian with a lamellar stolon, and
the structure of the fossil genus Syringopora, which has vertical
corallites united by horizontal solenia, clearly shows its affinity to
Tubipora. The Favositidae,
a fossil family from
the Silurian and Devonian,
have a massive corallum
composed of numerous
polygonal corallites closely
packed together. The
cavities of adjacent corallites
communicate by
means of numerous perforations,
which appear to
represent solenia, and
numerous transverse tabulae
are also present. In
<i>Favosites hemisphaerica</i> a
number of radial spines,
projecting into the cavity
of the corallite, give it the
appearance of a madreporarian coral.</p>

<p>In the order <span class="sc">Alcyonacea</span>
the colony consists
of bunches of elongate
cylindrical zooids, whose
proximal portions are united by solenia and compacted, by fusion
of their own walls and those of the solenia, into a fleshy mass
called the coenenchyma. Thus the coenenchyma forms a stem,
sometimes branched, from the surface of which the free portions of
the zooids project. The skeleton of the Alcyonacea consists of
separate calcareous spicules, which are often, especially in the
Nephthyidae, so abundant and so closely interlocked as to form a
tolerably firm and hard armour. The order comprises the families
<i>Xeniidae, Alcyonidae</i> and <i>Nephthyidae</i>. <i>Alcyonium digitatum</i>, a pink
digitate form popularly known as &ldquo;dead men&rsquo;s fingers,&rdquo; is common
in 10-20 fathoms of water off the English coasts.</p>

<p>In the order <span class="sc">Pseudaxonia</span> the colonies are upright and branched,
consisting of a number of short zooids whose proximal ends are imbedded in a coenenchyma containing numerous ramifying solenia
and spicules. The coenenchyma is further differentiated into a
medullary portion and a cortex. The latter contains the proximal
moieties of the zooids and numerous but separate spicules. The
medullary portion is densely crowded with spicules of different
shape from those in the
cortex, and in some forms
the spicules are cemented
together to form a hard
supporting axis. There are
four families of Pseudaxonia&mdash;the <i>Briareidae,
Sclerogorgidae, Melitodidae</i>,
and <i>Corallidae</i>. In the
first-named the medulla is
penetrated by solenia and
forms an indistinct axis;
in the remainder the medulla
is devoid of solenia,
and in the <i>Melitodidae</i> and
<i>Corallidae</i> it forms a dense
axis, which in the <i>Melitodidae</i>
consists of alternate
calcareous and horny joints.
The precious red coral of
commerce, <i>Corallium rubrum</i>
(fig. 6), a member of
the family <i>Corallidae</i>, is
found at depths varying
from 15 to 120 fathoms
the Mediterranean Sea, chiefly on the African coast. It owes its
commercial value to the beauty of its hard red calcareous axis which
in life is covered by a cortex in which the proximal moieties of the
zooids are imbedded. <i>Corallium rubrum</i> has been the subject of a
beautifully-illustrated memoir by de Lacaze-Duthiers, which should
be consulted for details of anatomy.</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Axifera</span> comprise those corals that have a horny or calcified
axis, which in position corresponds
to the axis of the
Pscudaxonia, but, unlike it,
is never formed of fused
spicules; the most familiar
example is the pink sea-fan,
<i>Gorgonia cavolinii</i>, which is
found in abundance in 10-25
fathoms of water off the
English coasts (fig. 7). In
this order the axis is formed
as an ingrowth of the ectoderm
of the base of the
mother zooid of the colony,
the cavity of the ingrowth
being filled by a horny substance
secreted by the ectoderm.
In <i>Gorgonia</i> the axis
remains horny throughout
life, but in many forms it is
further strengthened by a
deposit of calcareous matter
In the family <i>Isidinae</i> the
axis consists of alternate
segments of horny and calcareous
substance, the latter
being amorphous. The
order contains six families&mdash;the
<i>Dasygorgidae, Isidae,
Primnoidae, Muriceidae,
Plexauridae</i>, and <i>Gorgoniaae</i>.</p>

<p>In the order <span class="sc">Stelechotokea</span>
the colony consists of
a stem formed by a greatly-elongated
mother zooid, and
the daughter zooids are
borne as lateral buds on the
stem. In the section
<i>Asiphonacea</i> the colonies are
upright and branched,
springing from membranous
or ramifying stolons. They
resemble and are closely
allied to certain families of
the Cornulariidae, differing
from them only in mode of
budding and in the dispostion of the daughter zooids
round a central, much-elongated mother zooid. The section contains
two families, the <i>Telestidae</i> and the <i>Coelogorgidae</i>. The second section
comprises the <i>Pennatulacea</i> or sea-pens, which are remarkable from
the fact that the colony is not fixed by the base to a rock or other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>100</span>
object, but is imbedded in sand or mud by the proximal portion of
the stem known as the peduncle. In the typical genus, Pennatula
(fig. 8), the colony looks like a feather having a stem divisible into
an upper moiety or rachis, bearing lateral central leaflets (pinnae),
and a lower peduncle, which is sterile and imbedded in sand or mud.
The stem represents a greatly enlarged and elongated mother zooid.
It is divided longitudinally by a partition separating a so-called
&ldquo;ventral&rdquo; or prorachidial canal from a so-called &ldquo;dorsal&rdquo; or
metarachidial canal. A rod-like supporting axis of peculiar texture
is developed in the longitudinal partition, and a longitudinal canal
is hollowed out on either side of the axis in the substance of the
longitudinal partition, so that there are four stem-canals in all.
The prorachidial and metarachidial aspects of the rachis are sterile,
but the sides or pararachides bear numerous daughter zooids of
two kinds&mdash;(1) fully-formed autozooids, (2) small stunted
siphonozooids. The pinnae are formed by the elongated autozooids, whose
proximal portions are fused together to form a leaf-like expansion,
from the upper edge of which the distal extremities of the zooids
project. The siphonozooids are very numerous and lie between the
bases at the pinnae on the pararachides; they extend also on the
prorachidial and metarachidial surfaces. The calcareous skeleton
of the Pennatulacea consists of scattered spicules, but in one species,
<i>Protocaulon molle</i>, spicules are absent. Although of great interest
the Pennatulacea do not form an enduring skeleton or &ldquo;coral,&rdquo;
and need not be considered in detail in this place.</p>

<p class="pt2">The order <span class="sc">Coenothecalia</span> is represented by a single living species,
<i>Heliopora coerulea</i>, which differs from all recent Alcyonaria in the
fact that its skeleton is not composed of spicules, but is formed as
a secretion from a layer of cells called calicoblasts, which originate
from the ectoderm. The corallum of Heliopora is of a blue colour,
and has the form of broad, upright, lobed, or digitate masses flattened
from side to side. The surfaces are pitted all over with perforations
of two kinds, viz. larger star-shaped cavities, called <i>calices</i>, in
which the zooids are lodged, and very numerous smaller round or
polygonal apertures, which in life contain as many short unbranched
tubes, known as the <i>coenenchymal tubes</i> (fig. 9, A). The walls of the
calices and coenenchymal tubes are formed of flat plates of calcite,
which are so disposed that the walls of one tube enter into the composition
of the walls of adjacent tubes, and the walls of the calices
are formed by the walls of adjacent coenenchymal tubes. Thus the
architecture of the Helioporid colony differs entirely from such forms
as Tubipora or Favosites, in which each corallite has its own distinct
and proper wall. The cavities both of the calices and coenenchymal
tubes of Heliopora are closed below by horizontal partitions or
<i>tabulae</i>, hence the genus was formerly included in the group Tabulata,
and was supposed to belong to the madreporarian corals, both
because of its lamellar skeleton, which resembles that of a Madrepore,
and because each calicle has from twelve to fifteen radial partitions
or septa projecting into its cavity. The structure of the zooid of
Heliopora, however, is that of a typical Alcyonarian, and the septa
have only a resemblance to, but no real homology with, the similarly
named structures in madreporarian corals. <i>Heliopora coerulea</i> is
found between tide-marks on the shore platforms of coral islands.
The order was more abundantly represented in Palaeozoic times by
the <i>Heliolitidae</i> from the Upper and Lower Silurian and the Devonian,
and by the <i>Thecidae</i> from the Wenlock limestone. In <i>Heliolites
porosus</i> the colonies had the form of spheroidal masses; the calices
were furnished with twelve pseudosepta, and the coenenchymal
tubes were more or less regularly hexagonal.</p>

<p class="pt2"><span class="bold">Zoantharia.</span>&mdash;In this sub-class the arrangement of the mesenteries
is subject to a great deal of variation, but all the types hitherto
observed may be referred to a common plan, illustrated by the
living genus <i>Edwardsia</i> (fig. 10, A, B). This is a small solitary
Zoantharian which lives embedded in sand. Its body is divisible
into three portions, an upper <i>capitulum</i> bearing the mouth and
tentacles, a median <i>scapus</i> covered by a friable cuticle, and a terminal
physa which is rounded. Both capitulum and physa can be retracted
within the scapus. There are from sixteen to thirty-two simple
tentacles, but only eight mesenteries, all of which are complete.
The stomodaeum is compressed laterally, and is furnished with two
longitudinal grooves, a sulcus and a sulculus. The arrangement of
the muscle-banners on the mesenteries is characteristic. On six of
the mesenteries the muscle-banners have the same position as in
the Alcyonaria, namely, on the sulcar faces; but in the two remaining
mesenteries, namely, those which are attached on either side
of the sulcus, the muscle-banners are on the opposite or sulcular
faces. It is not known whether all the eight mesenteries of <i>Edwardsia</i>
are developed simultaneously or not, but in the youngest
form which has been studied all the eight mesenteries were present,
but only two of them, namely the sulco-laterals, bore mesenterial
filaments, and so it is presumed that they are the first pair to be
developed. In the common sea-anemone, <i>Actinia equina</i> (which
has already been quoted as a type of Anthozoan structure), the
mesenteries are numerous and are arranged in cycles. The mesenteries
of the first cycle are complete (<i>i.e.</i> are attached to the stomodaeum),
are twelve in number, and arranged in couples, distinguishable
by the position of the muscle-banners. In the four couples of
mesenteries which are attached to the sides of the elongated stomodaeum
the muscle-banners of each couple are turned towards one
another, but in the sulcar and sulcular couples, known as the directive
mesenteries, the muscle-banners are on the outer faces of the mesenteries,
and so are turned away from one another (see fig. 10, C).
The space enclosed between two mesenteries of the same couple is
called an <i>entocoele</i>; the space enclosed between two mesenteries of
adjacent couples is called an <i>exocoele</i>. The second cycle of mesenteries
consists of six couples, each formed in an exocoele of the
primary cycle, and in each couple the muscle-banners are <i>vis-à-vis</i>.
The third cycle comprises twelve couples, each formed in an exocoele
between the primary and secondary couples and so on, it being a
general rule (subject, however, to exceptions) that new mesenterial
couples are always formed in the exocoeles, and not in the entocoeles.</p>

<p class="pt2">While the mesenterial couples belonging to the second and each
successive cycle are formed simultaneously, those of the first cycle
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page101" id="page101"></a>101</span>
are formed in successive pairs, each member of a pair being placed
on opposite sides of the stomodaeum. Hence the arrangement in
six couples is a secondary and not a primary feature. In most
Actinians the mesenteries appear in the following order:&mdash;At the
time when the stomodaeum is formed, a single pair of mesenteries,
marked I, I in the diagram (fig. 11, A), makes its appearance, dividing
the coelenteric cavity into a smaller sulcar and a large sulcular
chamber. The muscle-banners of this pair are placed on the sulcar
faces of the mesenteries. Next, a pair of mesenteries, marked II, II
in the diagram, is developed in the sulcular chamber, its
muscle-banners facing the same way as those of I, I. The third pair is
formed in the sulcar chamber, in close connexion with the sulcus,
and in this case the muscle-banners are on the <i>sulcular</i> faces. The
fourth pair, having its muscle-banners on the sulcar faces, is developed
at the opposite extremity of the stomodaeum in close connexion
with the sulculus. There are now eight mesenteries present, having
exactly the same arrangement as in Edwardsia. A pause in the
development follows, during which no new mesenteries are formed,
and then the six-rayed symmetry characteristic of a normal Actinian
zooid is completed by the formation of the mesenteries V, V in the
lateral chambers, and VI, VI in the sulco-lateral chambers, their
muscle-banners being so disposed that they form couples respectively
with II, II and I, I. In <i>Actinia equina</i> the Edwardsia stage is arrived
at somewhat differently. The mesenteries second in order of formation
form the sulcular directives, those fourth in order of formation
form with the fifth the sulculo-lateral couples of the adult.</p>

<p class="pt2">As far as the anatomy of the zooid is concerned, the majority of
the stony or madreporarian corals agree exactly with the soft-bodied
Actinians, such as <i>Actinia equina</i>, both in the number and arrangement
of the adult mesenteries and in the order of development of
the first cycle. The few exceptions will be dealt with later, but it
may be stated here that even in these the first cycle of six couples
of mesenteries is always formed, and in all the cases which have
been examined the course of development described above is followed.
There are, however, several groups of Zoantharia in which the
mesenterial arrangement of the adult differs widely from that just
described. But it is possible to refer all these cases with more or
less certainty to the Edwardsian type.</p>

<p>The order <span class="sc">Zoanthidea</span> comprises a number of soft-bodied Zoantharians
generally encrusted with sand. Externally they resemble
ordinary sea-anemones, but there is only one ciliated groove, the
sulcus, in the stomodaeum, and the mesenteries are arranged on a
peculiar pattern. The first twelve mesenteries are disposed in
couples, and do not differ from those of Actinia except in size. The
mesenterial pairs I, II and III are attached to the stomodaeum,
and are called macromesenteries (fig. 12, B), but IV, V and VI are
much shorter, and are called micromesenteries. The subsequent
development is peculiar to the group. New mesenteries are formed
only in the sulco-lateral exocoeles. They are formed in couples,
each couple consisting of a macromesentery and a micromesentery,
disposed so that the former is nearest to the sulcar directives. The
derivation of the Zoanthidea from an Edwardsia form is sufficiently
obvious.</p>

<p>The order <span class="sc">Cerianthidea</span> comprises a few soft-bodied Zoantharians
with rounded aboral extremities pierced by pores. They have two
circlets of tentacles, a labial and a marginal, and there is only one
ciliated groove in the stomodaeum, which appears to be the sulculus.
The mesenteries are numerous, and the longitudinal muscles, though
distinguishable, are so feebly developed that there are no
muscle-banners. The larval forms of the type genus <i>Cerianthus</i> float freely
in the sea, and were once considered to belong to a separate genus,
<i>Arachnactis</i>. In this larva four pairs of mesenteries having the
typical Edwardsian arrangement are developed, but the fifth and
sixth pairs, instead of forming couples with the first and second,
arise in the sulcar chamber, the fifth pair inside the fourth, and the
sixth pair inside the fifth. New mesenteries are continually added
in the sulcar chamber, the seventh pair within the sixth, the eighth
pair within the seventh, and so on (fig. 13). In the Cerianthidea,
as in the Zoanthidea, much as the adult arrangement of mesenteries
differs from that of Actinia, the derivation from an Edwardsia stock
is obvious.</p>

<p>The order <span class="sc">Antipathidea</span> is a well-defined group whose affinities
are more obscure. The type form, <i>Antipathes dichotoma</i> (fig. 14),
forms arborescent colonies consisting of numerous zooids arranged
in a single series along one surface of a branched horny axis. Each
zooid has six tentacles; the stomodaeum is elongate, but the sulcus
and sulculus are very feebly represented. There are ten mesenteries
in which the musculature is so little developed as to be almost
indistinguishable. The sulcar and sulcular pairs of mesenteries are
short, the sulco-lateral and sulculo-lateral pairs are a little longer,
but the two transverse are very large and are the only mesenteries
which bear gonads. As the development of the Antipathidea is
unknown, it is impossible to say what is the sequence of the mesenterial
development, but in <i>Leiopathes glaberrima</i>, a genus with twelve
mesenteries, there are distinct indications of an Edwardsia stage.</p>

<p class="pt2">There are, in addition to these groups, several genera of Actinians
whose mesenterial arrangement differs from the normal type. Of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page102" id="page102"></a>102</span>
these perhaps the most interesting is <i>Gonactinia prolifera</i> (fig. 11, B),
with eight macromesenteries arranged on the Edwardsian plan.
Two pairs of micromesenteries form couples with the first and
second Edwardsian pairs, and in addition there is a couple of
micromesenteries in each of the sulculo-lateral exocoeles. Only the first
and second pairs of Edwardsian macromesenteries are fertile, <i>i.e.</i>
bear gonads.</p>

<p>The remaining forms, the <span class="sc">Actiniidea</span>, are divisible into the
Malacactiniae, or soft-bodied sea-anemones, which have already
been described sufficiently in the course of this article, and the

<p>All recent corals, as has already been said, conform so closely
to the anatomy of normal Actinians that they cannot be classified
apart from them, except that they are distinguished by the
possession of a calcareous skeleton. This skeleton is largely
composed of a number of radiating plates or <i>septa</i>, and it differs
both in origin and structure from the calcareous skeleton of all
Alcyonaria except Heliopora. It is formed, not from fused
spicules, but as a secretion of a special layer of cells derived from
the basal ectoderm, and known as <i>calicoblasts</i>. The skeleton or
corallum of a typical solitary coral&mdash;the common Devonshire cup-coral
<i>Caryophyllia smithii</i> (fig. 15) is a good example&mdash;exhibits
the followings parts:&mdash;(1) The <i>basal plate</i>, between the zooid and
the surface of attachment. (2) The <i>septa</i>, radial plates of
calcite reaching from the periphery nearly or quite to the centre
of the coral-cup or calicle. (3) The <i>theca</i> or wall, which in many
corals is not an independent structure, but is formed by the conjoined
thickened peripheral ends of the septa. (4) The <i>columella</i>,
a structure which occupies the centre of the calicle, and may
arise from the basal plate, when it is called essential, or may be
formed by union of trabecular offsets of the septa, when it is called
unessential. (5) The <i>costae</i>, longitudinal ribs or rows of spines
on the outer surface of the theca. True costae always correspond
to the septa, and are in fact the peripheral edges of the latter.
(6) <i>Epitheca</i>, an offset of the basal plate which surrounds the
base of the theca in a ring-like manner, and in some corals may
take the place of a true theca. (7) <i>Pali</i>, spinous or
blade-like upgrowths from the bottom of the calicle, which project between
the inner edges of certain septa and the columella. In addition
to these parts the following structures may exist in corals:&mdash;
<i>Dissepiments</i> are oblique calcareous partitions, stretching from
septum to septum, and closing the interseptal chambers below.
The whole system of dissepiments in any given calicle is often
called <i>endotheca</i>. <i>Synapticulae</i> are calcareous bars uniting adjacent
septa. <i>Tabulae</i> are stout horizontal partitions traversing the
centre of the calicle and dividing it into as many superimposed
chambers. The septa in recent corals always bear a definite
relation to the mesenteries, being found either in every entocoele
or in every entocoele and exocoele. Hence in corals in which
there is only a single cycle of mesenteries the septa are correspondingly
few in number; where several cycles of mesenteries
are present the septa are correspondingly numerous. In some
cases&mdash;<i>e.g.</i> in some species of <i>Madrepora</i>&mdash;only two septa are
fully developed, the remainder being very feebly represented.</p>

<p class="pt2">Though the corallum appears to live within the zooid, it is
morphologically external to it, as is best shown by its developmental
history. The larvae of corals are free swimming ciliated
forms known as planulae, and they do not acquire a corallum
until they fix themselves. A ring-shaped plate of calcite,
secreted by the ectoderm, is then formed, lying between the
embryo and the surface of attachment. As the mesenteries are
formed, the endoderm of the basal disk lying above the basal
plate is raised up in the form of radiating folds. There may be
six of these folds, one in each entocoele of the primary cycle of
mesenteries, or there may be twelve, one in each exocoele and
entocoele. The ectoderm beneath each fold becomes detached
from the surface of the basal plate, and both it and the mesogloea
are folded conformably with the endoderm. The cells forming
the limbs of the ectodermic folds secrete nodules of calcite, and
these, fusing together, give rise to six (or twelve) vertical radial
plates or septa. As growth proceeds new septa are formed
simultaneously with the new couples of secondary mesenteries.
In some corals, in which all the septa are entocoelic, each new
system is embraced by a mesenteric couple; in others, in which the
septa are both entocoelic and exocoelic, three septa are formed in
every chamber between two primary mesenterial couples, one in the
entocoele of the newly formed mesenterial couple of the secondary
cycle, and one in each exocoele between a primary and a secondary
couple. These latter are in turn embraced by the couples of the
tertiary cycle of mesenteries, and new septa are formed in the
exocoeles on either side of them, and so forth.</p>

<p class="pt2">It is evident from an inspection of figs. 16 and 17 that every
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page103" id="page103"></a>103</span>
septum is covered by a fold of endoderm, mesogloea, and
ectoderm, and is in fact pushed into the cavity of the zooid from
without. The zooid then is, as it were, moulded upon the
corallum. When fully extended, the upper part of the zooid
projects for some distance out of the calicle, and its wall is
reflected for some distance over the lip of the latter, forming a
fold of soft tissue extending to a greater or less distance over the
theca, and containing in most cases a cavity continuous over the lip
of the calicle with the coelenteron. This fold of tissue is known as
the <i>edge-zone</i> In some corals the septa are solid imperforate plates of
calcite, and their peripheral ends are either firmly welded together,
or are united by interstitial pieces so as to form imperforate
theca. In others the peripheral ends of the septa are united only
by bars or trabeculae, so that the theca is perforate, and in many
such perforate corals the septa themselves are pierced by
numerous perforations. In the former, which have been called
aporose corals, the only communication between the cavity of
the edge-zone and the general cavity of the zooid is by way of the
lip of the calicle; in the latter, or perforate corals, the theca is
permeated by numerous branching and anastomosing canals
lined by endoderm, which place the cavity of the edge-zone in
communication with the general cavity of the zooid.</p>

<p class="pt2">A large number of corals, both aporose and perforate, are
colonial. The colonies are produced by either budding or division.
In the former case the young daughter zooid, with its
corallum, arises wholly outside the cavity of the parent zooid,
and the component parts of the young corallum, septa, theca,
columella, &amp;c., are formed anew in every individual produced.
In division a vertical constriction divides a zooid into two equal
or unequal parts, and the several parts of the two corals thus
produced are severally derived from the corresponding parts of
the dividing corallum. In colonial corals a bud is always formed
from the edge-zone, and this bud develops into a new zooid
with its corallum. The cavity of the bud in an aporose coral
(fig. 18, A, C) does not communicate directly with that of the
parent form, but through the medium of the edge-zone. As
growth proceeds, and parent and bud become separated farther
from one another, the edge-zone forms a sheet of soft tissue,
bridging over the space between the two, and resting upon
projecting spines of the corallum. This sheet of tissue is called
the <i>coenosarc</i>. Its lower surface is clothed with a layer of
calicoblasts which continue to secrete carbonate of lime, giving
rise to a secondary deposit which more or less fills up the spaces
between the individual coralla, and is distinguished as <i>coenenchyme</i>.
This coenenchyme may be scanty, or may be so abundant
that the individual corallites produced by budding seem to be
immersed in it. Budding takes place in an analogous manner
in perforate corals (fig. 18, B), but the presence of the canal
system in the perforate theca leads to a modification of the process.
Buds arise from the edge-zone which already communicate
with the cavity of the zooid by the canals. As the buds develop
the canal system becomes much extended, and calcareous tissue
is deposited between the network of canals, the confluent edge-zones
of mother zooid and bud forming a coenosarc. As the
process continues a number of calicles are formed, imbedded in
a spongy tissue in which the canals ramify, and it is impossible
to say where the theca of one corallite ends and that of another
begins. In the formation of colonies by division a constriction
at right angles to the long axis of the mouth involves first the
mouth, then the peristome, and finally the calyx itself, so that
the previously single corallite becomes divided into two (fig. 18,
E). After division the corallites continue to grow upwards, and
their zooids may remain united by a bridge of soft tissue or
coenosarc. But in some cases, as they grow farther apart, this
continuity is broken, each corallite has its own edge-zone, and
internal continuity is also broken by the formation of dissepiments
within each calicle, all organic connexion between the
two zooids being eventually lost. Massive meandrine corals are
produced by continual repetition of a process of incomplete
division, involving the mouth and to some extent the peristome:
the calyx, however, does not divide, but elongates to form a
characteristic meandrine channel containing several zooid mouths.</p>

<p>Corals have been divided into <i>Aporosa</i> and <i>Perforata</i>, according
as the theca and septa are compact and solid, or are perforated
by pores containing canals lined by endoderm. The division
is in many respects convenient for descriptive purposes, but
recent researches show that it does not accurately represent the
relationships of the different families. Various attempts have
been made to classify corals according to the arrangement of the
septa, the characters of the theca, the microscopic structure of
the corallum, and the anatomy of the soft parts. The last-named
method has proved little more than that there is a remarkable
similarity between the zooids of all recent corals, the
differences which have been brought to light being for the most
part secondary and valueless for classificatory purposes. On the
other hand, the study of the anatomy and development of the
zooids has thrown much light upon the manner in which the
corallum is formed, and it is now possible to infer the structure
of the soft parts from a microscopical examination of the septa,
theca, &amp;c., with the result that unexpected relationships have
been shown to exist between corals previously supposed to
stand far apart. This has been particularly the case with the
group of Palaeozoic corals formerly classed together as <i>Rugosa</i>.
In many of these so-called rugose forms the septa have a characteristic
arrangement, differing from that of recent corals
chiefly in the fact that they show a tetrameral instead of a
hexameral symmetry. Thus in the family <i>Stauridae</i> there are
four chief septa whose inner ends unite in the middle of the
calicle to form a false columella, and in the <i>Zaphrentidae</i> there
are many instances of an arrangement, such as that depicted
in fig. 19, which represents the septal arrangement of <i>Streptelasma
corniculum</i> from the lower Silurian. In this coral the calicle is
divided into quadrants by four principal septa, the <i>main septum,
counter septum</i>, and two <i>alar septa</i>. The remaining septa are so
disposed that in the quadrants abutting on the chief septum
they converge towards that septum, whilst in the other quadrants
they converge towards the alar septa. The secondary septa show
a regular gradation in size, and, assuming that the smallest were
the most recently formed, it will be noticed that in the chief
quadrants the youngest septa lie nearest to the main septum;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page104" id="page104"></a>104</span>
in the other quadrants the youngest septa lie nearest to the alar
septa. This arrangement, however, is by no means characteristic
even of the Zaphrentidae, and in the family <i>Cyathophyllidae</i>
most of the genera exhibit a radial symmetry in which no trace
of the bilateral arrangement described above is recognizable,
and indeed in the genus <i>Cyathophyllum</i> itself a radial arrangement
is the rule. The connexion between the Cyathophyllidae and
modern Astraeidae is shown by <i>Moseleya latistellata</i>, a living
reef-building coral from Torres Strait. The general structure
of this coral leaves no doubt that it is closely allied to the
Astraeidae, but in the young calicles a tetrameral symmetry
is indicated by the presence of four large septa placed at right
angles to one another. Again, in the family <i>Amphiastraeidae</i>
there is commonly a single septum much larger than the rest,
and it has been shown that in the young calicles, <i>e.g.</i> of <i>Thecidiosmilia</i>,
two septa, corresponding to the main- and counter-septa
of Streptelasma, are first
formed, then two alar
septa, and afterwards
the remaining septa,
the latter taking on a
generally radial arrangement,
though the original
bilaterality is marked
by the preponderance of
the main septum. As
the microscopic character
of the corallum of
these extinct forms
agrees with that of recent
corals, it may be
assumed that the anatomy
of the soft parts
also was similar, and
the tetrameral arrangement,
when present,
may obviously be referred to a stage when only the first two
pairs of Edwardsian mesenteries were present and septa were
formed in the intervals between them.</p>

<p>Space forbids a discussion of the proposals to classify corals
after the minute structure of their coralla, but it will suffice
to say that it has been shown that the septa of all corals are built
up of a number of curved bars called trabeculae, each of which
is composed of a number of nodes. In many secondary corals
(<i>Cyclolites, Thamnastraea</i>) the trabeculae are so far separate
that the individual bars are easily recognizable, and each looks
something like a bamboo owing to the thickening of the two
ends of each node. The trabeculae are united together by these
thickened internodes, and the result is a fenestrated septum,
which in older septa may become solid and aporose by continual
deposit of calcite in the fenestrae. Each node of a trabecula
may be simple, <i>i.e.</i> have only one centre of calcification, or may
be compound. The septa of modern perforate corals are shown
to have a structure nearly identical with that of the secondary
forms, but the trabeculae and their nodes are only apparent on
microscopical examination. The aporose corals, too, have a
practically identical structure, their compactness being due to
the union of the trabeculae throughout their entire lengths instead
of at intervals, as in the Perforata. Further, the trabeculae
may be evenly spaced throughout the septum, or may be grouped
together, and this feature is probably of value in estimating the
affinities of corals. (For an account of coral formations see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Coral-Reefs</a></span>.)</p>

<p>In the present state of our knowledge the Zoantharia in which
a primary cycle of six couples of mesenteries is (or may be inferred
to be) completed by the addition of two pairs to the eight
Edwardsian mesenteries, and succeeding cycles are formed in
the exocoeles of the pre-existing mesenterial cycles, may be classed
in an order <span class="sc">Actiniidea</span>, and this may be divided into the suborders <i>Malacactiniae</i>, comprising the soft-bodied Actinians,
such as <i>Actinia, Sagartia, Bunodes</i>, &amp;c., and the <i>Scleractiniae</i>,
comprising the corals. The Scleractiniae may best be divided
into groups of families which appear to be most closely related
to one another, but it should not be forgotten that there is great
reason to believe that many if not most of the extinct corals
must have differed from modern Actiniidea in mesenterial
characters, and may have only possessed Edwardsian mesenteries,
or even have possessed only four mesenteries, in this respect
showing close affinities to the Stauromedusae. Moreover,
there are some modern corals in which the secondary cycle
of mesenteries departs from the Actinian plan. For example,
J.E. Duerden has shown that in <i>Porites</i> the ordinary zooids
possess only six couples of mesenteries arranged on the Actinian
plan. But some zooids grow to a larger size and develop a number
of additional mesenteries, which arise either in the sulcar or
the sulcular entocoele, much in the same manner as in Cerianthus.

hydrocarbon obtained from the fraction of the coal-tar distillate
boiling between 270° and 400° C. This high boiling fraction is
allowed to stand for some days, when it partially solidifies. It is
then separated in a centrifugal machine, the low melting-point
impurities are removed by means of hot water, and the residue
is finally hot-pressed. The crude anthracene cake is purified
by treatment with the higher pyridine bases, the operation being
carried out in large steam-jacketed boilers. The whole mass
dissolves on heating, and the anthracene crystallizes out on
cooling. The crystallized anthracene is then removed by a
centrifugal separator and the process of solution in the pyridine
bases is repeated. Finally the anthracene is purified by sublimation.</p>

<p>Many synthetical processes for the preparation of anthracene
and its derivatives are known. It is formed by the condensation
of acetylene tetrabromide with benzene in the presence of
aluminium chloride:&mdash;</p>

<div class="center pt2"><img style="width:404px; height:49px" src="images/img105a.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="noind">and similarly from methylene dibromide and benzene, and also
when benzyl chloride is heated with aluminium chloride to
200° C. By condensing ortho-brombenzyl bromide with sodium,
C.L. Jackson and J.F. White (<i>Ber</i>., 1879, 12, p. 1965) obtained
dihydro-anthracene</p>

<div class="center pt2"><img style="width:519px; height:35px" src="images/img105b.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="noind">Anthracene crystallizes in colourless monoclinic tables which
show a fine blue fluorescence. It melts at 213° C. and boils
at 351° C. It is insoluble in water, sparingly soluble in alcohol
and ether, but readily soluble in hot benzene. It unites with
picric acid to form a picrate, C<span class="su">14</span>H<span class="su">10</span>·C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">2</span>(NO<span class="su">2</span>)<span class="su">3</span>·OH, which
crystallizes in needles, melting at 138° C. On exposure to
sunlight a solution of anthracene in benzene or xylene
deposits para-anthracene (C<span class="su">14</span>H<span class="su">10</span>)<span class="su">2</span>, which melts at 244° C.
and passes back into the ordinary form. Chlorine and
bromine form both addition and substitution products with
anthracene; the addition product, anthracene dichloride,
C<span class="su">14</span>H<span class="su">10</span>Cl<span class="su">2</span>, being formed when chlorine is passed into a cold
solution of anthracene in carbon bisulphide. On treatment
with potash, it forms the substitution product, monochlor-anthracene,
C<span class="su">14</span>H<span class="su">9</span>Cl. Nitro-anthracenes are not as yet
known. The mono-oxyanthracenes (anthrols), C<span class="su">14</span>H<span class="su">9</span>OH or
<img style="width:168px; height:52px" src="images/img105d.jpg" alt="" />

<img style="width:166px; height:52px" src="images/img105e.jpg" alt="" />
(&gamma;) (anthranol) is a reduction product of
anthraquinone. &beta;-anthrol and anthranol give the corresponding
amino compounds (anthramines) when heated with ammonia.</p>

<p>Numerous sulphonic acids of anthracene are known, a monosulphonic
acid being obtained with dilute sulphuric acid, whilst
concentrated sulphuric acid produces mixtures of the anthracene
disulphonic acids. By the action of sodium amalgam on an
alcoholic solution of anthracene, an anthracene dihydride,
C<span class="su">14</span>H<span class="su">12</span>, is obtained, whilst by the use of stronger reducing agents,
such as hydriodic acid and amorphous phosphorus, hydrides
of composition C<span class="su">14</span>H<span class="su">16</span> and C<span class="su">14</span>H<span class="su">24</span> are produced.</p>

<p>Methyl and phenyl anthracenes are known; phenyl anthranol
(phthalidin) being somewhat closely related to the phenolphthaleins
(<i>q.v.</i>). Oxidizing agents convert anthracene into
anthraquinone (<i>q.v.</i>); the production of this substance by oxidizing
anthracene in glacial acetic acid solution, with chromic acid,
is the usual method employed for the estimation of anthracene.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANTHRACITE<a name="ar98" id="ar98"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="anthrax">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#945;&#958;</span>, coal), a term applied to those
varieties of coal which do not give off tarry or other hydrocarbon
vapours when heated below their point of ignition; or, in other
words, which burn with a smokeless and nearly non-luminous
flame. Other terms having the same meaning are, &ldquo;stone coal&rdquo;
(not to be confounded with the German <i>Steinkohle</i>) or &ldquo;blind
coal&rdquo; in Scotland, and &ldquo;Kilkenny coal&rdquo; in Ireland. The imperfect
anthracite of north Devon, which however is only used
as a pigment, is known as <i>culm</i>, the same term being used in
geological classification to distinguish the strata in which it is
found, and similar strata in the Rhenish hill countries which are
known as the Culm Measures. In America, culm is used as an
equivalent for waste or slack in anthracite mining.</p>

<p>Physically, anthracite differs from ordinary bituminous coal by
its greater hardness, higher density, 1.3-1.4, and lustre, the latter
being often semi-metallic with a somewhat brownish reflection.
It is also free from included soft or fibrous notches and does
not soil the fingers when rubbed. Structurally it shows some
alteration by the development of secondary divisional planes and
fissures so that the original stratification lines are not always
easily seen. The thermal conductivity is also higher, a lump of
anthracite feeling perceptibly colder when held in the warm
hand than a similar lump of bituminous coal at the same temperature.
The chemical composition of some typical anthracites is
given in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Coal</a></span>.</p>

<p>Anthracite may be considered to be a transition stage between
ordinary bituminous coal and graphite, produced by the more or
less complete elimination of the volatile constituents of the
former; and it is found most abundantly in areas that have been
subjected to considerable earth-movements, such as the flanks
of great mountain ranges. The largest and most important
anthracite region, that of the north-eastern portion of the Pennsylvania
coal-field, is a good example of this; the highly contorted
strata of the Appalachian region produce anthracite
exclusively, while in the western portion of the same basin on
the Ohio and its tributaries, where the strata are undisturbed,
free-burning and coking coals, rich in volatile matter, prevail. In
the same way the anthracite region of South Wales is confined
to the contorted portion west of Swansea and Llanelly, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page106" id="page106"></a>106</span>
central and eastern portions producing steam, coking and
house coals.</p>

<p>Anthracites of newer, tertiary or cretaceous age, are found in
the Crow&rsquo;s Nest part of the Rocky Mountains in Canada, and
at various points in the Andes in Peru.</p>

<p>The principal use of anthracite is as a smokeless fuel. In the
eastern United States, it is largely employed as domestic fuel,
usually in close stoves or furnaces, as well as for steam purposes,
since, unlike that from South Wales, it does not decrepitate when
heated, or at least not to the same extent. For proper use, however,
it is necessary that the fuel should be supplied in pieces as nearly
uniform in size as possible, a condition that has led to the development
of the breaker which is so characteristic a feature in American
anthracite mining (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Coal</a></span>). The large coal as raised from the
mine is passed through breakers with toothed rolls to reduce the
lumps to smaller pieces, which are separated into different sizes
by a system of graduated sieves, placed in descending order.
Each size can be perfectly well burnt alone on an appropriate
grate, if kept free from larger or smaller admixtures. The
common American classification is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>Lump, steamboat, egg and stove coals, the latter in two or three
sizes, all three being above 1½ in. size on round-hole screens.</p>

<p>From the pea size downwards the principal use is for steam
purposes. In South Wales a less elaborate classification is
adopted; but great care is exercised in hand-picking and cleaning
the coal from included particles of pyrites in the higher qualities
known as best malting coals, which are used for kiln-drying
malt and hops.</p>

<p>Formerly, anthracite was largely used, both in America and
South Wales, as blast-furnace fuel for iron smelting, but for this
purpose it has been largely superseded by coke in the former
country and entirely in the latter. An important application
has, however, been developed in the extended use of internal
combustion motors driven by the so-called &ldquo;mixed,&rdquo; &ldquo;poor,&rdquo;
&ldquo;semi-water&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dowson gas&rdquo; produced by the gasification
of anthracite with air and a small proportion of steam. This
is probably the most economical method of obtaining power
known; with an engine as small as 15 horse-power the expenditure
of fuel is at the rate of only 1 &#8468; per horse-power hour, and
with larger engines it is proportionately less. Large quantities of
anthracite for power purposes are now exported from South
Wales to France, Switzerland and parts of Germany.</p>

fact of the remains first described having been obtained from
the Tertiary lignite-beds of Europe), a genus of extinct artiodactyle
ungulate mammals, characterized by having 44 teeth,
with five semi-crescentic cusps on the crowns of the upper
molars. In many respects, especially the form of the lower jaw,
<i>Anthracotherium</i>, which is of Oligocene and Miocene age in
Europe, and typifies the family <i>Anthracotheriidae</i>, is allied to the
hippopotamus, of which it is probably an ancestral form. The
European <i>A. magnum</i> was as large as the last-mentioned animal,
but there were several smaller species and the genus also occurs
in Egypt, India and North America. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Artiodactyla</a></span>.)</p>

anthracene, first prepared in 1834 by A. Laurent. It is prepared
commercially from anthracene by stirring a sludge of anthracene
and water in horizontal cylinders with a mixture of sodium
bichromate and caustic soda. This suspension is then run through
a conical mill in order to remove all grit, the cones of the mill
fitting so tightly that water cannot pass through unless the mill is
running; the speed of the mill when working is about 3000
revolutions per minute. After this treatment, the mixture is
run into lead-lined vats and treated with sulphuric acid, steam
is blown through the mixture in order to bring it to the boil, and
the anthracene is rapidly oxidized to anthraquinone. When the
oxidation is complete, the anthraquinone is separated in a filter
press, washed and heated to 120° C. with commercial oil of
vitriol, using about 2½ parts of vitriol to 1 of anthraquinone.
It is then removed to lead-lined tanks and again washed with
water and dried; the product obtained contains about 95% of
anthraquinone. It may be purified by sublimation. Various
synthetic processes have been used for the preparation of anthraquinone.
A. Behr and W.A. v. Dorp (<i>Ber.</i>, 1874, 7, p. 578) obtained
orthobenzoyl benzoic acid by heating phthalic anhydride with
benzene in the presence of aluminium chloride. This compound
on heating with phosphoric anhydride loses water and yields
anthraquinone,</p>

<div class="center pt2"><img style="width:477px; height:43px" src="images/img106.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p class="noind">It may be prepared in a similar manner by heating phthalyl
chloride with benzene in the presence of aluminium chloride.
Dioxy- and tetraoxy-anthraquinones are obtained when meta-oxy- and
dimeta-dioxy-benzoic acids are heated with concentrated
sulphuric acid.</p>

<p>Anthraquinone crystallizes in yellow needles or prisms, which
melt at 277° C. It is soluble in hot benzene, sublimes easily, and
is very stable towards oxidizing agents. On the other hand,
it is readily attacked by reducing agents. With zinc dust in
presence of caustic soda it yields the secondary alcohol oxan-thranol,
C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">4</span> : CO·CHOH : C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">4</span>, with tin and hydrochloric acid,
the phenolic compound anthranol, C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">4</span> : CO·C(OH) : C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">4</span>; and
with hydriodic acid at 150° C. or on distillation with zinc dust,
the hydrocarbon anthracene, C<span class="su">14</span>H<span class="su">10</span>. When fused with caustic
potash, it gives benzoic acid. It behaves more as a ketone than
as a quinone, since with hydroxylamine it yields an oxime, and on
reduction with zinc dust and caustic soda it yields a secondary
alcohol, whilst it cannot be reduced by means of sulphurous
acid. Various sulphonic acids of anthraquinone are known, as
well as oxy-derivatives, for the preparation and properties of
which see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Alizarin</a></span>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTHRAX<a name="ar101" id="ar101"></a></span> (the Greek for &ldquo;coal,&rdquo; or &ldquo;carbuncle,&rdquo; so called
by the ancients because they regarded it as burning like coal;
cf. the French equivalent <i>charbon</i>; also known as <i>fièvre charbonneuse,
Milzbrand</i>, splenic fever, and malignant pustule), an
acute, specific, infectious, virulent disease, caused by the <i>Bacillus
anthracis</i>, in animals, chiefly cattle, sheep and horses, and
frequently occurring in workers in the wool or hair, as well as in
those handling the hides or carcases, of beasts which have been
affected.</p>

<p><i>Animals.</i>&mdash;As affecting wild as well as domesticated animals
and man, anthrax has been widely diffused in one or more of its
forms, over the surface of the globe. It at times decimates the
reindeer herds in Lapland and the Polar regions, and is only too
well known in the tropics and in temperate latitudes. It has
been observed and described in Russia, Siberia, Central Asia,
China, Cochin-China, Egypt, West Indies, Peru, Paraguay,
Brazil, Mexico, and other parts of North and South America, in
Australia, and on different parts of the African continent, while
for other European countries the writings which have been
published with regard to its nature, its peculiar characteristics,
and the injury it inflicts are innumerable. Countries in which
are extensive marshes, or the subsoil of which is tenacious or
impermeable, are usually those most frequently and seriously
visited. Thus there have been regions notorious for its prevalence,
such as the marshes of Sologne, Dombes and Bresse in
France; certain parts of Germany, Hungary and Poland; in
Spain the half-submerged valleys and the maritime coasts of
Catalonia, as well as the Romagna and other marshy districts of
Italy; while it is epizootic, and even panzootic, in the swampy
regions of Esthonia, Livonia, Courland, and especially of Siberia,
where it is known as the <i>Sibirskaja jaswa</i> (Siberian boil-plague).
The records of anthrax go back to a very ancient date. It is
supposed to be the murrain of Exodus. Classical writers allude
to anthrax as if it were the only cattle disease worthy of
mention (see Virgil, <i>Georg.</i> iii.). It figures largely in the history
of the early and middle ages as a devastating pestilence attacking
animals, and through them mankind; the oldest Anglo-Saxon
manuscripts contain many fantastic recipes, leechdoms,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page107" id="page107"></a>107</span>
charms and incantations for the prevention or cure of the
&ldquo;blacan blezene&rdquo; (black blain) and the relief of the &ldquo;elfshot&rdquo;
creatures. In the 18th and 19th centuries it sometimes spread
like an epizootic over the whole of Europe, from Siberia to
France. It was in this malady that disease-producing germs
(<i>bacteria</i>) were first discovered, in 1840, by Pollender of Wipperfürth,
and, independently, by veterinary surgeon Brauell of
Dorpat, and their real character afterwards verified by C.J.
Davaine (1812-1882) of Alfort in 1863; and it was in their
experiments with this disease that Toussaint, Pasteur and
J.B. Chauveau first showed how to make the morbific poison its
own antidote. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Vivisection</a></span>.)</p>

<p>The symptoms vary with the species of animal, the mode of
infection, and the seat of the primary lesion, internal or external.
In all its forms anthrax is an inoculable disease, transmission
being surely and promptly effected by this means, and it may be
conveyed to nearly all animals by inoculation of a wound of the
skin or through the digestive organs. Cattle, sheep and horses
nearly always owe their infection to spores or bacilli ingested
with their food or water, and pigs usually contract the disease by
eating the flesh of animals dead of anthrax.</p>

<p>Internal anthrax, of cattle and sheep, exhibits no premonitory
symptoms that can be relied on. Generally the first indication
of an outbreak is the sudden death of one or more of the herd or
flock. Animals which do not die at once may be noticed to
stagger and tremble; the breathing becomes hurried and the
pulse very rapid, while the heart beats violently; the internal
temperature of the body is high, 104° to 106° F.; blood oozes
from the nose, mouth and anus, the visible mucous membranes
are dusky or almost black. The animal becomes weak and listless,
the temperature falls and death supervenes in a few hours,
being immediately preceded by delirium, convulsions or coma.
While death is usually rapid or sudden when the malady is
general, constituting what is designated splenic apoplexy,
internal anthrax in cattle is not invariably fatal. In some cases
the animal rallies from a first attack and gradually recovers.</p>

<p>In the external or localized form, marked by the formation
of carbuncles before general infection takes place, death may
not occur for several days. The carbuncles may appear in any
part of the body, being preceded or accompanied by fever.
They are developed in the subcutaneous connective tissue
where this is loose and plentiful, in the interstices of the muscles,
lymphatic glands, in the mucous membranes of the mouth and
tongue (glossanthrax of cattle), pharynx and larynx (<i>anthrax
angina</i> of horses and pigs), and the rectum. They begin as
small circumscribed swellings which are warm, slightly painful
and oedematous. In from two to eight hours they attain a considerable
size, are cold, painless and gangrenous, and when
they are incised a quantity of a blood-stained gelatinous exudate
escapes. When the swellings have attained certain proportions
symptoms of general infection appear, and, running their course
with great rapidity, cause death in a few hours. Anthrax of the
horse usually begins as an affection of the throat or bowel. In
the former there is rapid obstructive oedema of the mucous
membrane of the pharynx and larynx with swelling of the throat
and neck, fever, salivation, difficulty in swallowing, noisy
breathing, frothy discharge from the nose and threatening
suffocation. General invasion soon ensues, and the horse may
die in from four to sixteen hours. The intestinal form is marked
by high temperature, great prostration, small thready pulse,
tumultuous action of the heart, laboured breathing and symptoms
of abdominal pain with straining and diarrhoea. When moved
the horse staggers and trembles. Profuse sweating, a falling
temperature and cyanotic mucous membranes indicate the
approach of a fatal termination.</p>

<p>In splenic fever or splenic apoplexy, the most marked alterations
observed after death are&mdash;the effects of rapid decomposition,
evidenced by the foul odour, disengagement of gas beneath
the skin and in the tissues and cavities of the body, yellow or
yellowish-red gelatinous exudation into and between the muscles,
effusion of citron or rust-coloured fluid in various cavities,
extravasations of blood and local congestions throughout the
body, the blood in the vessels generally being very dark and
tar-like. The most notable feature, however, in the majority of
cases is the enormous enlargement of the spleen, which is engorged
with blood to such an extent that it often ruptures, while
its tissue is changed into a violet or black fluid mass.</p>

<p>The bacillus of anthrax, under certain conditions, retains its
vitality for a long time, and rapidly grows when it finds a suitable
field in which to develop, its mode of multiplication being by
scission and the formation of spores, and depending, to a great
extent at least, on the presence of oxygen. The morbid action
of the bacillus is indeed said to be due to its affinity for oxygen;
by depriving the red corpuscles of the blood of that most essential
gas, it renders the vital fluid unfit to sustain life. Albert Hoffa
and others assert that the fatal lesions are produced by the
poisonous action of the toxins formed by the bacilli and not by
the blocking up of the minute blood-vessels, or the abstraction
of oxygen from the blood by the bacilli.</p>

<p>It was by the cultivation of this micro-organism, or attenuation
of the virus, that Pasteur was enabled to produce a prophylactic
remedy for anthrax. His discovery was first made with regard
to the cholera of fowls, a most destructive disorder which
annually carries off great numbers of poultry. Pasteur produced
his inoculation material by the cultivation of the bacilli at a
temperature of 42° C. in oxygen. Two vaccines are required.
The first or weak vaccine is obtained by incubating a bouillon
culture for twenty-four days at 42° C., and the second or less
attenuated vaccine by incubating a bouillon culture, at the same
temperature, for twelve days. Pasteur&rsquo;s method of protective
inoculation comprises two inoculations with an interval of twelve
days between them. Immunity, established in about fifteen
days after the injection of the second vaccine, lasts from nine
months to a year.</p>

<p>Toussaint had, previous to Pasteur, attenuated the virus of
anthrax by the action of heat; and Chauveau subsequently
corroborated by numerous experiments the value of Toussaint&rsquo;s
method, demonstrating that, according to the degree of heat
to which the virus is subjected, so is its inocuousness when
transferred to a healthy creature. In outbreaks of anthrax on
farms where many animals are exposed to infection immediate
temporary protection can be conferred by the injection of
anthrax serum.</p>

<p><i>Human Beings.</i>&mdash;For many years cases of sudden death had
been observed to occur from time to time among healthy men
engaged in woollen manufactories, particularly in the work of
sorting or combing wool. In some instances death appeared to
be due to the direct inoculation of some poisonous material into
the body, for a form of malignant pustule was observed upon
the skin; but, on the other hand, in not a few cases without any
external manifestation, symptoms of blood-poisoning, often
proving rapidly fatal, suggested the probability of other channels
for the introduction of the disease. In 1880 the occurrence of
several such cases among woolsorters at Bradford, reported
by Dr J.H. Bell of that town, led to an official inquiry in England
by the Local Government Board, and an elaborate investigation
into the pathology of what was then called &ldquo;woolsorters&rsquo; disease&rdquo;
was at the same time conducted at the Brown Institution, London,
by Professor W.S. Greenfield. Among the results of this inquiry
it was ascertained: (1) that the disease appeared to be identical
with that occurring among sheep and cattle; (2) that in the blood
and tissues of the body was found in abundance, as in the disease
in animals, the <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>, and (3) that the skins, hair,
wool, &amp;c., of animals dying of anthrax retain this infecting
organism, which, under certain conditions, finds ready access
to the bodies of the workers.</p>

<p>Two well-marked forms of this disease in man are recognized,
&ldquo;external anthrax&rdquo; and &ldquo;internal anthrax.&rdquo; In external
anthrax the infecting agent is accidentally inoculated into some
portion of skin, the seat of a slight abrasion, often the hand,
arm or face. A minute swelling soon appears at the part, and
develops into a vesicle containing serum or bloody matter,
and varying in size, but seldom larger than a shilling. This
vesicle speedily bursts and leaves an ulcerated or sloughing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page108" id="page108"></a>108</span>
surface, round about which are numerous smaller vesicles which
undergo similar changes, and the whole affected part becomes
hard and tender, while the surrounding surface participates
in the inflammatory action, and the neighbouring lymphatic
glands are also inflamed. This condition, termed &ldquo;malignant
pustule,&rdquo; is frequently accompanied with severe constitutional
disturbance, in the form of fever, delirium, perspirations, together
with great prostration and a tendency to death from septicaemia,
although on the other hand recovery is not uncommon. It
was repeatedly found that the matter taken from the vesicle
during the progress of the disease, as well as the blood in the
body after death, contained the <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>, and when
inoculated into small animals produced rapid death, with all
the symptoms and post-mortem appearances characteristic of
che disease as known to affect them.</p>

<p>In internal anthrax there is no visible local manifestation
of the disease, and the spores or bacilli appear to gain access
to the system from the air charged with them, as in rooms where
the contaminated wool or hair is unpacked, or again during
the process of sorting. The symptoms usually observed are those
of rapid physical prostration, with a small pulse, somewhat
lowered temperature (rarely fever), and quickened breathing.
Examination of the chest reveals inflammation of the lungs and
pleura. In some cases death takes place by collapse in less
than one day, while in others the fatal issue is postponed for
three or four days, and is preceded by symptoms of blood-poisoning,
including rigors, perspirations, extreme exhaustion,
&amp;c. In some cases of internal anthrax the symptoms are more
intestinal than pulmonary, and consist in severe exhausting
diarrhoea, with vomiting and rapid sinking. Recovery from
the internal variety, although not unknown, is more rare than
from the external, and its most striking phenomena are its sudden
onset in the midst of apparent health, the rapid development
of physical prostration, and its tendency to a fatal termination
despite treatment. The post-mortem appearances in internal
anthrax are such as are usually observed in septicaemia, but in
addition evidence of extensive inflammation of the lungs, pleura
and bronchial glands has in most cases been met with. The
blood and other fluids and the diseased tissues are found loaded
with the <i>Bacillus anthracis</i>.</p>

<p>Treatment in this disease appears to be of but little avail,
except as regards the external form, where the malignant pustule
may be excised or dealt with early by strong caustics to destroy
the affected textures. For the relief of the general constitutional
symptoms, quinine, stimulants and strong nourishment appear
to be the only available means. An anti-anthrax serum has
also been tried. As preventive measures in woollen manufactories,
the disinfection of suspicious material, or the wetting
of it before handling, is recommended as lessening the risk to
the workers.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTHROPOID APES,<a name="ar102" id="ar102"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Manlike Apes</span>, the name given to
the family of the Simiidae, because, of all the ape-world, they
most closely resemble man. This family includes four kinds,
the gibbons of S.E. Asia, the orangs of Borneo and Sumatra,
the gorillas of W. Equatorial Africa, and the chimpanzees of
W. and Central Equatorial Africa. Each of these apes resembles
man most in some one physical characteristic: the gibbons
in the formation of the teeth, the orangs in the brain-structure,
the gorillas in size, and the chimpanzees in the sigmoid flexure of
the spine. In general structure they all closely resemble human
beings, as in the absence of tails; in their semi-erect position
(resting on finger-tips or knuckles); in the shape of vertebral
column, sternum and pelvis; in the adaptation of the arms
for turning the palm uppermost at will; in the possession of a
long vermiform appendix to the short caecum of the intestine;
in the size of the cerebral hemispheres and the complexity of
their convolutions. They differ in certain respects, as in the proportion
of the limbs, in the bony development of the eyebrow
ridges, and in the opposable great toe, which fits the foot to be
a climbing and grasping organ.</p>

<p>Man differs from them in the absence of a hairy coat; in the
development of a large lobule to the external ear; in his fully
erect attitude; in his flattened foot with the non-opposable
great toe; in the straight limb-bones; in the wider pelvis;
in the marked sigmoid flexure of his spine; in the perfection
of the muscular movements of the arm; in the delicacy of hand;
in the smallness of the canine teeth and other dental peculiarities;
in the development of a chin; and in the small size of his jaws
compared to the relatively great size of the cranium. Together
with man and the baboons, the anthropoid apes form the group
known to science as Catarhini, those, that is, possessing a
narrow nasal septum, and are thus easily distinguishable from
the flat-nosed monkeys or Platyrhini. The anthropoid apes are
arboreal and confined to the Old World. They are of special
interest from the important place assigned to them in the
arguments of Darwin and the Evolutionists. It is generally
admitted now that no fundamental anatomical difference can
be proved to exist between these higher apes and man, but it
is equally agreed that none probably of the Simiidae is in the
direct line of human ancestry. There is a great gap to be bridged
between the highest anthropoid and the lowest man, and much
importance has been attached to the discovery of an extinct
primate, Pithecanthropus (<i>q.v.</i>), which has been regarded as
the &ldquo;missing link.&rdquo;</p>

science), the science which, in its strictest sense, has as its
object the study of man as a unit in the animal kingdom. It is
distinguished from ethnology, which is devoted to the study of
man as a <i>racial</i> unit, and from ethnography, which deals with
the <i>distribution</i> of the races formed by the aggregation of such
units. To anthropology, however, in its more general sense as
the natural history of man, ethnology and ethnography may
both be considered to belong, being related as parts to a whole.</p>

<p>Various other sciences, in conformity with the above definition,
must be regarded as subsidiary to anthropology, which yet hold
their own independent places in the field of knowledge. Thus
anatomy and physiology display the structure and functions of
the human body, while psychology investigates the operations
of the human mind. Philology deals with the general principles
of language, as well as with the relations between the languages
of particular races and nations. Ethics or moral science treats
of man&rsquo;s duty or rules of conduct toward his fellow-men. Sociology
and the science of culture are concerned with the origin
and development of arts and sciences, opinions, beliefs, customs,
laws and institutions generally among mankind within historic
time; while beyond the historical limit the study is continued
by inferences from relics of early ages and remote districts, to
interpret which is the task of prehistoric archaeology and
geology.</p>

<p>I. <i>Man&rsquo;s Place in Nature.</i>&mdash;In 1843 Dr J.C. Prichard, who
perhaps of all others merits the title of founder of modern
anthropology, wrote in his <i>Natural History of Man</i>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;The organized world presents no contrasts and resemblances
more remarkable than those which we discover on comparing mankind
with the inferior tribes. That creatures should exist so nearly
approaching to each other in all the particulars of their physical
structure, and yet differing so immeasurably in their endowments
and capabilities, would be a fact hard to believe, if it were not
manifest to our observation. The differences are everywhere
striking: the resemblances are less obvious in the fulness of their
extent, and they are never contemplated without wonder by those
who, in the study of anatomy and physiology, are first made aware
how near is man in his physical constitution to the brutes. In all
the principles of his internal structure, in the composition and
functions of his parts, man is but an animal. The lord of the earth,
who contemplates the eternal order of the universe, and aspires to
communion with its invisible Maker, is a being composed of the
same materials, and framed on the same principles, as the creatures
which he has tamed to be the servile instruments of his will, or slays
for his daily food. The points of resemblance are innumerable;
they extend to the most recondite arrangements of that mechanism
which maintains instrumentally the physical life of the body, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page109" id="page109"></a>109</span>
brings forward its early development and admits, after a given period,
its decay, and by means of which is prepared a succession of similar
beings destined to perpetuate the race.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The acknowledgment of man&rsquo;s structural similarity with the
anthropomorphous species nearest approaching him, viz.: the
higher or anthropoid apes, had long before Prichard&rsquo;s day
been made by Linnaeus, who in his <i>Systema Naturae</i> (1735)
grouped them together as the highest order of Mammalia, to
which he gave the name of Primates. The <i>Amoenitates Academicae</i>
(vol. vi., Leiden, 1764), published under the auspices of
Linnaeus, contains a remarkable picture which illustrates a
discourse by his disciple Hoppius, and is here reproduced (see
Plate, fig. 1). In this picture, which shows the crudeness of the
zoological notions current in the 18th century as to both men
and apes, there are set in a row four figures: (<i>a</i>) a recognizable
orang-utan, sitting and holding a staff; (<i>b</i>) a chimpanzee,
absurdly humanized as to head, hands, and feet; (<i>c</i>) a hairy
woman, with a tail a foot long; (<i>d</i>) another woman, more
completely coated with hair. The great Swedish naturalist was
possibly justified in treating the two latter creatures as quasi-human,
for they seem to be grotesque exaggerations of such
tailed and hairy human beings as really, though rarely, occur,
and are apt to be exhibited as monstrosities (see Bastian and
Hartmann, <i>Zeitschrift für Ethnologie</i>, Index, &ldquo;Geschwänzte
Menschen&rdquo;; Gould and Pile, <i>Anomalies and Curiosities of
Medicine</i>, 1897). To Linnaeus, however, they represented normal
anthropomorpha or man-like creatures, vouched for by visitors
to remote parts of the world. This opinion of the Swedish
naturalist seems to have been little noticed in Great Britain till
it was taken up by the learned but credulous Scottish judge,
Lord Monboddo (see his <i>Origin and Progress of Language</i>, 1774,
&amp;c.; <i>Antient Metaphysics</i>, 1778). He had not heard of the
tailed men till he met with them in the work of Linnaeus, with
whom he entered into correspondence, with the result that he
enlarged his range of mankind with races of sub-human type.
One was founded on the description by the Swedish sailor
Niklas Köping of the ferocious men with long tails inhabiting
the Nicobar Islands. Another comprised the orang-utans of
Sumatra, who were said to take men captive and set them to
work as slaves. One of these apes, it was related, served as a
sailor on board a Jamaica ship, and used to wait on the captain.
These are stories which seem to carry their own explanation.
When the Nicobar Islands were taken over by the British
government two centuries later, the native warriors were still
wearing their peculiar loin-cloth hanging behind in a most tail-like
manner (E.H. Man, <i>Journal Anthropological Institute</i>, vol.
xv. p. 442). As for the story of the orang-utan cabin boy, this
may even be verbally true, it being borne in mind that in the
Malay languages the term <i>orang-utan</i>, &ldquo;man of the forest,&rdquo; was
originally used for inland forest natives and other rude men,
rather than for the <i>miyas</i> apes to which it has come to be generally
applied by Europeans. The speculations as to primitive man
connected with these stories diverted the British public, headed
by Dr Johnson, who said that Monboddo was &ldquo;as jealous of his
tail as a squirrel.&rdquo; Linnaeus&rsquo;s primarily zoological classification
of man did not, however, suit the philosophical opinion of the
time, which responded more readily to the systems represented
by Buffon, and later by Cuvier, in which the human mind and
soul formed an impassable wall of partition between him and
other mammalia, so that the definition of man&rsquo;s position in the
animal world was treated as not belonging to zoology, but to
metaphysics and theology. It has to be borne in mind that
Linnaeus, plainly as he recognized the likeness of the higher
simian and the human types, does not seem to have entertained
the thought of accounting for this similarity by common descent.
It satisfied his mind to consider it as belonging to the system of
nature, as indeed remained the case with a greater anatomist of
the following century, Richard Owen. The present drawing,
which under the authority of Linnaeus shows an anthropomorphic
series from which the normal type of man, the <i>Homo
sapiens</i>, is conspicuously absent, brings zoological similarity into
view without suggesting kinship to account for it. There are few
ideas more ingrained in ancient and low civilization than that of
relationship by descent between the lower animals and man.
Savage and barbaric religions recognize it, and the mythology
of the world has hardly a more universal theme. But in educated
Europe such ideas had long been superseded by the influence of
theology and philosophy, with which they seemed too incompatible.
In the 19th century, however, Lamarck&rsquo;s theory of the
development of new species by habit and circumstance led
through Wallace and Darwin to the doctrines of the hereditary
transmission of acquired characters, the survival of the fittest,
and natural selection. Thenceforward it was impossible to
exclude a theory of descent of man from ancestral beings whom
zoological similarity connects also, though by lines of descent
not at all clearly defined, with ancestors of the anthropomorphic
apes. In one form or another such a theory of human descent
has in our time become part of an accepted framework of zoology,
if not as a demonstrable truth, at any rate as a working hypothesis
which has no effective rival.</p>

<p>The new development from Linnaeus&rsquo;s zoological scheme
which has thus ensued appears in Huxley&rsquo;s diagram of simian
and human skeletons (fig. 2, (<i>a</i>) gibbon; (<i>b</i>) orang; (<i>c</i>) chimpanzee;
(<i>d</i>) gorilla; (<i>e</i>) man). Evidently suggested by the
Linnean picture, this is brought up to the modern level of
zoology, and continued on to man, forming an introduction to
his zoological history hardly to be surpassed. Some of the main
points it illustrates may be briefly stated here, the reader being
referred for further information to Huxley&rsquo;s <i>Essays</i>. In tracing
the osteological characters of apes and man through this series,
the general system of the skeletons, and the close correspondence
in number and arrangement of vertebrae and ribs, as well as in
the teeth, go far towards justifying the opinion of hereditary
connexion. At the same time, the comparison brings into view
differences in human structure adapted to man&rsquo;s pre-eminent
mode of life, though hardly to be accounted its chief causes.
It may be seen how the arrangement of limbs suited for going
on all-fours belongs rather to the apes than to man, and walking
on the soles of the feet rather to man than the apes. The two
modes of progression overlap in human life, but the child&rsquo;s
tendency when learning is to rest on the soles of the feet and the
palms of the hands, unlike the apes, which support themselves
on the sides of the feet and the bent knuckles of the hands. With
regard to climbing, the long stretch of arm and the grasp with
both hands and feet contribute to the arboreal life of the apes,
contrasting with what seem the mere remains of the climbing
habit to be found even among forest savages. On the whole,
man&rsquo;s locomotive limbs are not so much specialized to particular
purposes, as generalized into adaptation to many ends. As to the
mechanical conditions of the human body, the upright posture
has always been recognized as the chief. To it contributes the
balance of the skull on the cervical vertebrae, while the human
form of the pelvis provides the necessary support to the intestines
in the standing attitude. The marked curvature of the vertebral
column, by breaking the shock to the neck and head in running
and leaping, likewise favours the erect position. The lowest
coccygeal vertebrae of man remain as a rudimentary tail. While
it is evident that high importance must be attached to the
adaptation of the human body to the life of diversified intelligence
and occupation he has to lead, this must not be treated as though
it were the principal element of the superiority of man, whose
comparison with all lower genera of mammals must be mainly
directed to the intellectual organ, the brain. Comparison of the
brains of vertebrate animals (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Brain</a></span>) brings into view the
immense difference between the small, smooth brain of a fish or
bird and the large and convoluted organ in man. In man, both
size and complexity contribute to the increased area of the
cortex or outer layer of the brain, which has been fully ascertained
to be the seat of the mysterious processes by which sensation
furnishes the groundwork of thought. Schäfer (<i>Textbook of
Physiology</i>, vol. ii. p. 697) thus defines it: &ldquo;The cerebral cortex
is the seat of the intellectual functions, of intelligent sensation
or consciousness, of ideation, of volition, and of memory.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The relations between man and ape are most readily stated in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page110" id="page110"></a>110</span>
comparison with the gorilla, as on the whole the most anthropomorphous
ape. In the general proportions of the body and limbs
there is a marked difference between the gorilla and man. The
gorilla&rsquo;s brain-case is smaller, its trunk larger, its lower limbs
shorter, its upper limbs longer in proportion than those of man.
The differences between a gorilla&rsquo;s skull and a man&rsquo;s are truly
immense. In the gorilla, the face, formed largely by the massive
jaw-bones, predominates over the brain-case or cranium; in the
man these proportions are reversed. In man the occipital
foramen, through which passes the spinal cord, is placed just
behind the centre of the base of the skull, which is thus evenly
balanced in the erect posture, whereas the gorilla, which goes
habitually on all fours, and whose skull is inclined forward, in
accordance with this posture has the foramen farther back. In
man the surface of the skull is comparatively smooth, and the
brow-ridges project but little, while in the gorilla these ridges
overhang the cavernous orbits like penthouse roofs. The absolute
capacity of the cranium of the gorilla is far less than that of man;
the smallest adult human cranium hardly measuring less than 63
cub. in., while the largest gorilla cranium measured had a content
of only 34½ cub. in. The largest proportional size of the facial
bones, and the great projection of the jaws, confer on the gorilla&rsquo;s
skull its small facial angle and brutal character, while its teeth differ
from man&rsquo;s in relative size and number of fangs. Comparing the
lengths of the extremities, it is seen that the gorilla&rsquo;s arm is of
enormous length, in fact about one-sixth longer than the spine,
whereas a man&rsquo;s arm is one-fifth shorter than the spine; both
hand and foot are proportionally much longer in the gorilla than
in man; the leg does not so much differ. The vertebral column
of the gorilla differs from that of man in its curvature and other
characters, as also does the conformation of its narrow pelvis.
The hand of the gorilla corresponds essentially as to bones and
muscles with that of man, but is clumsier and heavier; its thumb
is &ldquo;opposable&rdquo; like a human thumb, that is, it can easily meet
with its extremity the extremities of the other fingers, thus
possessing a character which does much to make the human hand
so admirable an instrument; but the gorilla&rsquo;s thumb is proportionately
shorter than man&rsquo;s. The foot of the higher apes,
though often spoken of as a hand, is anatomically not such, but
a prehensile foot. It has been argued by Sir Richard Owen and
others that the position of the great toe converts the foot of the
higher apes into a hand, an extremely important distinction from
man; but against this Professor T.H. Huxley maintained that
it has the characteristic structure of a foot with a very movable
great toe. The external unlikeness of the apes to man depends
much on their hairiness, but this and some other characteristics
have no great zoological value. No doubt the difference between
man and the apes depends, of all things, on the relative size and
organization of the brain. While similar as to their general
arrangement to the human brain, those of the higher apes, such
as the chimpanzee, are much less complex in their convolutions,
as well as much less in both absolute and relative weight&mdash;the
weight of a gorilla&rsquo;s brain hardly exceeding 20 oz., and a man&rsquo;s
brain hardly weighing less thin 32 oz., although the gorilla is
considerably the larger animal of the two.</p>

<p>These anatomical distinctions are undoubtedly of great moment,
and it is an interesting question whether they suffice to place man
in a zoological order by himself. It is plain that some eminent
zoologists, regarding man as absolutely differing as to mind and
spirit from any other animal, have had their discrimination of
mere bodily differences unconsciously sharpened, and have been
led to give differences, such as in the brain or even the foot of
the apes and man, somewhat more importance than if they had
merely distinguished two species of apes. Many naturalists hold
the opinion that the anatomical differences which separate the
gorilla or chimpanzee from man are in some respects less than
those which separate these man-like apes from apes lower in the
scale. Yet all authorities class both the higher and lower apes
in the same order. This is Huxley&rsquo;s argument, some prominent
points of which are the following: As regards the proportion of
limbs, the hylobates or gibbon is as much longer in the arms than
the gorilla as the gorilla is than the man, while on the other hand,
it is as much longer in the legs than the man as the man is than
the gorilla. As to the vertebral column and pelvis, the lower
apes differ from the gorilla as much as, or more than, it differs
from man. As to the capacity of the cranium, men differ from
one another so extremely that the largest known human skull
holds nearly twice the measure of the smallest, a larger proportion
than that in which man surpasses the gorilla; while, with proper
allowance for difference of size of the various species, it appears
that some of the lower apes fall nearly as much below the higher
apes. The projection of the muzzle, which gives the character
of brutality to the gorilla as distinguished from the man, is yet
further exaggerated in the lemurs, as is also the backward position
of the occipital foramen. In characters of such importance as the
structure of the hand and foot, the lower apes diverge extremely
from the gorilla; thus the thumb ceases to be opposable in the
American monkeys, and in the marmosets is directed forwards,
and armed with a curved claw like the other digits, the great
toe in these latter being insignificant in proportion. The same
argument can be extended to other points of anatomical structure,
and, what is of more consequence, it appears true of the brain.
A series of the apes, arranged from lower to higher orders, shows
gradations from a brain little higher that that of a rat, to a brain
like a small and imperfect imitation of a man&rsquo;s; and the greatest
structural break in the series lies not between man and the man-like
apes, but between the apes and monkeys on one side, and the
lemurs on the other. On these grounds Huxley, restoring in
principle the Linnean classification, desired to include man in the
order of <i>Primates</i>. This order he divided into seven families:
first, the <i>Anthropini</i>, consisting of man only; second, the
<i>Catarhini</i> or Old World apes; third, the <i>Platyrhini</i>,
all New World apes, except the marmosets; fourth, the <i>Arclopithecini</i>,
or marmosets; fifth, the <i>Lemurini</i>, or lemurs; sixth and seventh,
the <i>Cheiromyini</i> and <i>Galeopithecini</i>.</p>

<p>It is in assigning to man his place in nature on psychological
grounds that the greater difficulty arises. Huxley acknowledged
an immeasurable and practically infinite divergence, ending in
the present enormous psychological gulf between ape and man.
It is difficult to account for this intellectual chasm as due to
some minor structural difference. The opinion is deeply rooted
in modern as in ancient thought, that only a distinctively human
element of the highest import can account for the severance
between man and the highest animal below him. Differences in
the mechanical organs, such as the perfection of the human hand
as an instrument, or the adaptability of the human voice to the
expression of human thought, are indeed of great value. But
they have not of themselves such value, that to endow an ape
with the hand and vocal organs of a man would be likely to raise
it through any large part of the interval that now separates it
from humanity. Much more is to be said for the view that man&rsquo;s
larger and more highly organized brain accounts for those mental
powers in which he so absolutely surpasses the brutes.</p>

<p>The distinction does not seem to lie principally in the range
and delicacy of direct sensation, as may be judged from such
well-known facts as man&rsquo;s inferiority to the eagle in sight, or
to the dog in scent. At the same time, it seems that the human
sensory organs may have in various respects acuteness beyond
those of other creatures. But, beyond a doubt, man possesses,
and in some way possesses by virtue of his superior brain, a
power of co-ordinating the impressions of his senses, which
enables him to understand the world he lives in, and by understanding
to use, resist, and even in a measure rule it. No
human art shows the nature of this human attribute more clearly
than does language. Man shares with the mammalia and birds
the direct expression of the feelings by emotional tones and
interjectional cries; the parrot&rsquo;s power of articulate utterance
almost equals his own; and, by association of ideas in some
measure, some of the lower animals have even learnt to recognize
words he utters. But, to use words in themselves unmeaning,
as symbols by which to conduct and convey the complex intellectual
processes in which mental conceptions are suggested,
compared, combined, and even analysed, and new ones created&mdash;
this is a faculty which is scarcely to be traced in any lower animal.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page111" id="page111"></a>111</span>
The view that this, with other mental processes, is a function of
the brain, is remarkably corroborated by modern investigation
of the disease of aphasia, where the power of thinking remains,
but the power is lost of recalling the word corresponding to the
thought, and this mental defect is found to accompany a diseased
state of a particular locality of the brain (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Aphasia</a></span>). This
may stand among the most perfect of the many evidences that,
in Professor Bain&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;the brain is the principal, though
not the sole organ of mind.&rdquo; As the brains of the vertebrate
animals form an ascending scale, more and more approaching
man&rsquo;s in their arrangement, the fact here finds its explanation,
that lower animals perform mental processes corresponding
in their nature to our own, though of generally less power and
complexity. The full evidence of this correspondence will be
found in such works as Brehm&rsquo;s <i>Thierleben</i>; and some of the
salient points are set forth by Charles Darwin, in the chapter
on &ldquo;Mental Powers,&rdquo; in his <i>Descent of Man</i>. Such are the
similar effects of terror on man and the lower animals, causing
the muscled to tremble, the heart to palpitate, the sphincters
to be relaxed, and the hair to stand on end. The phenomena
of memory, as to both persons and places, is strong in animals,
as is manifest by their recognition of their masters, and their
returning at once to habits of which, though disused for many years,
their brain has not lost the stored-up impressions. Such facts
as that dogs &ldquo;hunt in dreams,&rdquo; make it likely that their minds
are not only sensible to actual events, present and past, but can,
like our minds, combine revived sensations into ideal scenes
in which they are actors,&mdash;that is to say, they have the faculty
of imagination. As for the reasoning powers in animals, the
accounts of monkeys learning by experience to break eggs carefully,
and pick off bits of shell, so as not to lose the contents,
or of the way in which rats or martens after a while can no longer
be caught by the same kind of trap, with innumerable similar
facts, show in the plainest way that the reason of animals goes
so far as to form by new experience a new hypothesis of cause
and effect which will henceforth guide their actions. The
employment of mechanical instruments, of which instances of
monkeys using sticks and stones furnish the only rudimentary
traces among the lower animals, is one of the often-quoted
distinctive powers of man. With this comes the whole vast
and ever-widening range of inventive and adaptive art, where
the uniform hereditary instinct of the cell-forming bee and the
nest-building bird is supplanted by multiform processes and
constructions, often at first rude and clumsy in comparison to
those of the lower instinct, but carried on by the faculty of
improvement and new invention into ever higher stages. &ldquo;From
the moment,&rdquo; writes A.R. Wallace (<i>Natural Selection</i>), &ldquo;when
the first skin was used as a covering, when the first rude spear
was formed to assist in the chase, when fire was first used to
cook his food, when the first seed was sown or shoot planted,
a grand revolution was effected in nature, a revolution which
in all the previous ages of the earth&rsquo;s history had had no parallel;
for a being had arisen who was no longer necessarily subject
to change with the changing universe,&mdash;a being who was in some
degree superior to nature, inasmuch as he knew how to control
and regulate her action, and could keep himself in harmony
with her, not by a change in body, but by an advance of mind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As to the lower instincts tending directly to self-preservation,
it is acknowledged on all hands that man has them in a less
developed state than other animals; in fact, the natural
defencelessness of the human being, and the long-continued care and
teaching of the young by the elders, are among the commonest
themes of moral discourse. Parental tenderness and care for
the young are strongly marked among the lower animals, though
so inferior in scope and duration to the human qualities; and
the same may be said of the mutual forbearance and defence
which bind together in a rudimentary social bond the families
and herds of animals. Philosophy seeking knowledge for its
own sake; morality, manifested in the sense of truth, right, and
virtue; and religion, the belief in and communion with superhuman
powers ruling and pervading the universe, are human
characters, of which it is instructive to trace, if possible, the
earliest symptoms in the lower animals, but which can there
show at most only faint and rudimentary signs of their wondrous
development in mankind. That the tracing of physical and
even intellectual continuity between the lower animals and our
own race, does not necessarily lead the anthropologist to lower
the rank of man in the scale of nature, may be shown by citing
A.R. Wallace. Man, he considers, is to be placed &ldquo;apart, as
not only the head and culminating point of the grand series
of organic nature, but as in some degree a new and distinct
order of being.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To regard the intellectual functions of the brain and nervous
system as alone to be considered in the psychological comparison
of man with the lower animals, is a view satisfactory to those
thinkers who hold materialistic views. According to this school,
man is a machine, no doubt the most complex and wonderfully
adapted of all known machines, but still neither more nor less
than an instrument whose energy is provided by force from
without, and which, when set in action, performs the various
operations for which its structure fits it, namely, to live, move,
feel, and think. This view, however, always has been strongly
opposed by those who accept on theological grounds a spiritualistic
doctrine, or what is, perhaps, more usual, a theory which
combines spiritualism and materialism in the doctrine of a
composite nature in man, animal as to the body and in some
measure as to the mind, spiritual as to the soul. It may be useful,
as an illustration of one opinion on this subject, to continue
here the citation of Dr Prichard&rsquo;s comparison between man and
the lower animals:&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;If it be inquired in what the still more remarkable difference
consists, it is by no means easy to reply. By some it will be said
that man, while similar in the organization of his body to the lower
tribes, is distinguished from them by the possession of an immaterial
soul, a principle capable of conscious feeling, of intellect and thought.
To many persons it will appear paradoxical to ascribe the endowment
of a soul to the inferior tribes in the creation, yet it is difficult to
discover a valid argument that limits the possession of an immaterial
principle to man. The phenomena of feeling, of desire and aversion,
of love and hatred, of fear and revenge, and the perception of external
relations manifested in the life of brutes, imply, not only through
the analogy which they display to the human faculties, but likewise
from all that we can learn or conjecture of their particular nature,
the superadded existence of a principle distinct from the mere
mechanism of material bodies. That such a principle must exist in
all beings capable of sensation, or of anything analogous to human
passions and feelings, will hardly be denied by those who perceive
the force of arguments which metaphysically demonstrate the
immaterial nature of the mind. There may be no rational grounds for
the ancient dogma that the souls of the lower animals were
imperishable, like the soul of man: this is, however, a problem which
we are not called upon to discuss; and we may venture to conjecture
that there may be immaterial essences of divers kinds, and endowed
with various attributes and capabilities. But the real nature of
these unseen principles eludes our research: they are only known
to us by their external manifestations. These manifestations are
the various powers and capabilities, or rather the habitudes of
action, which characterize the different orders of being, diversified
according to their several destinations.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>Dr Prichard here puts forward distinctly the time-honoured
doctrine which refers the mental faculties to the operation of
the soul. The view maintained by a distinguished comparative
anatomist, Professor St George Mivart, in his <i>Genesis of Species</i>,
ch. xii., may fairly follow. &ldquo;Man, according to the old scholastic
definition, is &lsquo;a rational animal&rsquo; (<i>animal rationale</i>), and his
animality is distinct in nature from his rationality, though
inseparably joined, during life, in one common personality. Man&rsquo;s
animal body must have had a different source from that of the
spiritual soul which informs it, owing to the distinctness of the
two orders to which those two existences severally belong.&rdquo;
The two extracts just given, however, significant in themselves,
fail to render an account of the view of the human constitution
which would probably, among the theological and scholastic
leaders of public opinion, count the largest weight of adherence.
According to this view, not only life but thought are functions
of the animal system, in which man excels all other animals
as to height of organization: but beyond this, man embodies an
immaterial and immortal spiritual principle which no lower
creature possesses, and which makes the resemblance of the apes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>112</span>
to him but a mocking simulance. To pronounce any absolute
decision on these conflicting doctrines is foreign to our present
purpose, which is to show that all of them count among their
adherents men of high rank in science.</p>

<p>II. <i>Origin of Man.</i>&mdash;Opinion as to the genesis of man is
divided between the theories of creation and evolution. In
both schools, the ancient doctrine of the contemporaneous
appearance on earth of all species of animals having been abandoned
under the positive evidence of geology, it is admitted that
the animal kingdom, past and present, includes a vast series of
successive forms, whose appearances and disappearances have
taken place at intervals during an immense lapse of ages. The
line of inquiry has thus been directed to ascertaining what
formative relation subsists among these species and genera,
the last link of the argument reaching to the relation between
man and the lower creatures preceding him in time. On both
the theories here concerned it would be admitted, in the words
of Agassiz (<i>Principles of Zoology</i>, pp. 205-206), that &ldquo;there is a
manifest progress in the succession of beings on the surface of
the earth. This progress consists in an increasing similarity of
the living fauna, and, among the vertebrates especially, in their
increasing resemblance to man.&rdquo; Agassiz continues, however,
in terms characteristic of the creationist school: &ldquo;But this
connexion is not the consequence of a direct lineage between the
faunas of different ages. There is nothing like parental descent
connecting them. The fishes of the Palaeozoic age are in no
respect the ancestors of the reptiles of the Secondary age, nor
does man descend from the mammals which preceded him in the
Tertiary age. The link by which they are connected is of a higher
and immaterial nature; and their connexion is to be sought in
the view of the Creator himself, whose aim in forming the earth,
in allowing it to undergo the successive changes which geology
has pointed out, and in creating successively all the different
types of animals which have passed away, was to introduce man
upon the surface of our globe. Man is the end towards which all
the animal creation has tended from the first appearance of the
first Palaeozoic fishes.&rdquo; The evolutionist, on the contrary (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Evolution</a></span>), maintains that different successive species of
animals are in fact connected by parental descent, having
become modified in the course of successive generations. The
result of Charles Darwin&rsquo;s application of this theory to man
may be given in his own words (<i>Descent of Man</i>, part i. ch. 6):&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;The Catarhine and Platyrhine monkeys agree in a multitude of
characters, as is shown by their unquestionably belonging to one
and the same order. The many characters which they possess in
common can hardly have been independently acquired by so many
distinct species; so that these characters must have been inherited.
But an ancient form which possessed many characters common to
the Catarhine and Platyrhine monkeys, and others in an intermediate
condition, and some few perhaps distinct from those now
present in either group, would undoubtedly have been ranked, if
seen by a naturalist, as an ape or a monkey. And as man under a
genealogical point of view belongs to the Catarhine or Old World
stock, we must conclude, however much the conclusion may revolt
our pride, that our early progenitors would have been properly thus
designated. But we must not fall into the error of supposing that
the early progenitor of the whole Simian stock, including man,
was identical with, or even closely resembled, any existing ape or
monkey.&rdquo;</p>
</div>

<p>The problem of the origin of man cannot be properly discussed
apart from the full problem of the origin of species. The
homologies between man and other animals which both schools
try to account for; the explanation of the intervals, with
apparent want of intermediate forms, which seem to the creationists
so absolute a separation between species; the evidence of
useless &ldquo;rudimentary organs,&rdquo; such as in man the external shell
of the ear, and the muscle which enables some individuals to
twitch their ears, which rudimentary parts the evolutionists
claim to be only explicable as relics of an earlier specific condition,&mdash;these,
which are the main points of the argument on the
origin of man, belong to general biology. The philosophical
principles which underlie the two theories stand for the most
part in strong contrast, the theory of evolution tending toward
the supposition of ordinary causes, such as &ldquo;natural selection,&rdquo;
producing modifications in species, whether by gradual
accumulation or more sudden leaps, while the theory of creation has
recourse to acts of supernatural intervention (see the duke of
Argyll, <i>Reign of Law</i>, ch. v.). St George Mivart (<i>Genesis of
Species</i>) propounded a theory of a natural evolution of man as
to his body, combined with a supernatural creation as to his
soul; but this attempt to meet the difficulties on both sides
seems to have satisfied neither.</p>

<p>The wide acceptance of the Darwinian theory, as applied to
the descent of man, has naturally roused anticipation that
geological research, which provides evidence of the animal life
of incalculably greater antiquity, would furnish fossil remains
of some comparatively recent being intermediate between the
anthropomorphic and the anthropic types. This expectation
has hardly been fulfilled, but of late years the notion of a variety
of the human race, geologically ancient, differing from any known
in historic times, and with characters approaching the simian,
has been supported by further discoveries. To bring this to the
reader&rsquo;s notice, top and side views of three skulls, as placed
together in the human development series in the Oxford University
Museum, are represented in the plate, for the purpose of
showing the great size of the orbital ridges, which the reader
may contrast with his own by a touch with his fingers on his
forehead. The first (fig. 3) is the famous Neanderthal skull from
near Düsseldorf, described by Schaafhausen in Müller&rsquo;s <i>Archiv</i>,
1858; Huxley in Lyell, <i>Antiquity of Man</i>, p. 86, and in <i>Man&rsquo;s
Place in Nature</i>. The second (fig. 4) is the skull from the cavern
of Spy in Belgium (de Puydt and Lohest, <i>Compte rendu du
Congrès de Namur</i>, 1886). The foreheads of these two skulls
have an ape-like form, obvious on comparison with the simian
skulls of the gorilla and other apes, and visible even in the
small-scale figures in the Plate, fig. 2. Among modern tribes of mankind
the forehead of the Australian aborigines makes the nearest
approach to this type, as was pointed out by Huxley. This brief
description will serve to show the importance of a later discovery.
At Trinil, in Java, in an equatorial region where, if anywhere, a
being intermediate between the higher apes and man would seem
likely to be found, Dr Eugene Dubois in 1891-1892 excavated
from a bed, considered by him to be of Sivalik formation
(Pliocene), a thighbone which competent anatomists decide to be
human, and a remarkably depressed calvaria or skull-cap (fig. 5),
bearing a certain resemblance in its proportions to the corresponding
part of the simian skull. These remains were referred
by their discoverer to an animal intermediate between man and
ape, to which he gave the name of <i>Pithecanthropus erectus</i> (<i>q.v.</i>),
but the interesting discussions on the subject have shown
divergence of opinion among anatomists. At any rate, classing
the Trinil skull as human, it may be described as tending towards
the simian type more than any other known.</p>

<p>III. <i>Races of Mankind.</i>&mdash;The classification of mankind into a
number of permanent varieties or races, rests on grounds which
are within limits not only obvious but definite. Whether from a
popular or a scientific point of view, it would be admitted that a
Negro, a Chinese, and an Australian belong to three such
permanent varieties of men, all plainly distinguishable from one
another and from any European. Moreover, such a division
takes for granted the idea which is involved in the word race,
that each of these varieties is due to special ancestry, each race
thus representing an ancient breed or stock, however these breeds
or stocks may have had their origin. The anthropological
classification of mankind is thus zoological in its nature, like
that of the varieties or species of any other animal group, and
the characters on which it is based are in great measure physical,
though intellectual and traditional peculiarities, such as moral
habit and language, furnish important aid. Among the best-marked
race-characters are the colour of the skin, eyes and hair;
and the structure and arrangement of the latter. Stature is by
no means a general criterion of race, and it would not, for instance,
be difficult to choose groups of Englishmen, Kaffirs, and
North American Indians, whose mean height should hardly
differ. Yet in many cases it is a valuable means of distinction,
as between the tall Patagonians and the stunted Fuegians, and
even as a help in minuter problems, such as separating the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>113</span>
Teutonic and Celtic ancestry in the population of England (see
Beddoe, &ldquo;Stature and Bulk of Man in the British Isles,&rdquo; in
<i>Mem. Anthrop. Soc. London</i>, vol. iii.) Proportions of the limbs,
compared in length with the trunk, have been claimed as constituting
peculiarities of African and American races; and
other anatomical points, such as the conformation of the pelvis,
have speciality. But inferences of this class have hardly attained
to sufficient certainty and generality to be set down in the form
of rules. The conformation of the skull is second only to the
colour of the skin as a criterion for the distinction of race; and the
position of the jaws is recognized as important, races being
described as prognathous when the jaws project far, as in the
Australian or Negro, in contradistinction to the orthognathous
type, which is that of the ordinary well-shaped European skull.
On this distinction in great measure depends the celebrated
&ldquo;facial angle,&rdquo; measured by Camper as a test of low and high
races; but this angle is objectionable as resulting partly from
the development of the forehead and partly from the position of
the jaws. The capacity of the cranium is estimated in cubic
measure by filling it with sand, &amp;c., with the general result that
the civilized white man is found to have a larger brain than the
barbarian or savage. Classification of races on cranial measurements
has long been attempted by eminent anatomists, and in
certain cases great reliance may be placed on such measurements.
Thus the skulls of an Australian and a Negro would be generally
distinguished by their narrowness and the projection of the jaw
from that of any Englishman; but the Australian skull would
usually differ perceptibly from the Negroid in its upright sides
and strong orbital ridges. The relation of height to breadth
may also furnish a valuable test; but it is acknowledged by all
experienced craniologists, that the shape of the skull may vary
so much within the same tribe, and even the same family, that
it must be used with extreme caution, and if possible only in
conjunction with other criteria of race. The general contour of
the face, in part dependent on the form of the skull, varies much
in different races, among whom it is loosely defined as oval,
lozenge-shaped, pentagonal, &amp;c. Of particular features, some
of the most marked contrasts to European types are seen in the
oblique Chinese eyes, the broad-set Kamchadale cheeks, the
pointed Arab chin, the snub Kirghiz nose, the fleshy protuberant
Negro lips, and the broad Kalmuck ear. Taken altogether, the
features have a typical character which popular observation
seizes with some degree of correctness, as in the recognition of
the Jewish countenance in a European city.</p>

<p>Were the race-characters constant in degree or even in kind,
the classification of races would be easy; but this is not so.
Every division of mankind presents in every character wide
deviations from a standard. Thus the Negro race, well marked
as it may seem at the first glance, proves on closer examination
to include several shades of complexion and features, in some
districts varying far from the accepted Negro type; while the
examination of a series of native American tribes shows that,
notwithstanding their asserted uniformity of type, they differ
in stature, colour, features and proportions of skull. (See
Prichard, <i>Nat. Hist. of Man</i>; Waitz, <i>Anthropology</i>, part i. sec. 5.)
Detailed anthropological research, indeed, more and more justifies
Blumenbach&rsquo;s words, that &ldquo;innumerable varieties of mankind
run into one another by insensible degrees.&rdquo; This state of
things, due partly to mixture and crossing of races, and partly
to independent variation of types, makes the attempt to arrange
the whole human species within exactly bounded divisions an
apparently hopeless task. It does not follow, however, that the
attempt to distinguish special races should be given up, for there
at least exist several definable types, each of which so far prevails
in a certain population as to be taken as its standard. L.A.J.
Quetelet&rsquo;s plan of defining such types will probably meet with
general acceptance as the scientific method proper to this branch
of anthropology. It consists in the determination of the standard
or typical &ldquo;mean man&rdquo; (<i>homme moyen</i>) of a population,
with reference to any particular quality, such as stature, weight,
complexion, &amp;c. In the case of stature, this would be done by
measuring a sufficient number of men, and counting how many
of them belong to each height on the scale. If it be thus ascertained,
as it might be in an English district, that the 5 ft. 7 in.
men form the most numerous group, while the 5 ft. 6 in. and 5 ft.
8 in. men are less in number, and the 5 ft. 5 in. and 5 ft. 9 in.
still fewer, and so on until the extremely small number of
extremely short or tall individuals of 5 ft. or 7 ft. is reached, it
will thus be ascertained that the stature of the mean or typical
man is to be taken as 5 ft. 7 in. The method is thus that of
selecting as the standard the most numerous group, on both
sides of which the groups decrease in number as they vary in
type. Such classification may show the existence of two or
more types, in a community, as, for instance, the population of a
Californian settlement made up of Whites and Chinese might
show two predominant groups (one of 5 ft. 8 in., the other of
5 ft. 4 in.) corresponding to these two racial types. It need
hardly be said that this method of determining the mean type
of a race, as being that of its really existing and most numerous
class, is altogether superior to the mere calculation of an average,
which may actually be represented by comparatively few individuals,
and those the exceptional ones. For instance, the
average stature of the mixed European and Chinese population
just referred to might be 5 ft. 6 in.&mdash;a worthless and indeed
misleading result. (For particulars of Quetelet&rsquo;s method, see
his <i>Physique sociale</i> (1869), and <i>Anthropométrie</i> (1871).)</p>

<p>Classifications of man have been numerous, and though,
regarded as systems, most of them are unsatisfactory, yet they
have been of great value in systematizing knowledge, and are
all more or less based on indisputable distinctions. J.F. Blumenbach&rsquo;s
division, though published as long ago as 1781, has had
the greatest influence. He reckons five races, viz. Caucasian,
Mongolian, Ethiopian, American, Malay. The ill-chosen name
of Caucasian, invented by Blumenbach in allusion to a South
Caucasian skull of specially typical proportions, and applied
by him to the so-called white races, is still current; it brings into
one race peoples such as the Arabs and Swedes, although these
are scarcely less different than the Americans and Malays, who
are set down as two distinct races. Again, two of the best-marked
varieties of mankind are the Australians and the Bushmen,
neither of whom, however, seems to have a natural place in
Blumenbach&rsquo;s series. The yet simpler classification by Cuvier
into Caucasian, Mongol and Negro corresponds in some measure
with a division by mere complexion into white, yellow and
black races; but neither this threefold division, nor the ancient
classification into Semitic, Hamitic and Japhetic nations can be
regarded as separating the human types either justly or sufficiently
(see Prichard, <i>Natural History of Man</i>, sec. 15; Waitz, <i>Anthropology</i>,
vol. i. part i. sec. 5). Schemes which set up a larger
number of distinct races, such as the eleven of Pickering, the
fifteen of Bory de St Vincent and the sixteen of Desmoulins,
have the advantage of finding niches for most well-defined human
varieties; but no modern naturalist would be likely to adopt
any one of these as it stands. In criticism of Pickering&rsquo;s system,
it is sufficient to point out that he divides the white nations
into two races, entitled the Arab and the Abyssinian (Pickering,
<i>Races of Man</i>, ch. i.). Agassiz, Nott, Crawfurd and others who
have assumed a much larger number of races or species of
man, are not considered to have satisfactorily defined a corresponding
number of distinguishable types. On the whole,
Huxley&rsquo;s division probably approaches more nearly than any
other to such a tentative classification as may be accepted in
definition of the principal varieties of mankind, regarded from
a zoological point of view, though anthropologists may be disposed
to erect into separate races several of his widely-differing
sub-races. He distinguishes four principal types of mankind,
the Australioid, Negroid, Mongoloid and Xanthochroic (&ldquo;fair
whites&rdquo;), adding a fifth variety, the Melanochroic (&ldquo;dark
whites&rdquo;).</p>

<p>In determining whether the races of mankind are to be classed
as varieties of one species, it is important to decide whether
every two races can unite to produce fertile offspring. It is
settled by experience that the most numerous and well-known
crossed races, such as the Mulattos, descended from Europeans
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>114</span>
and Negroes&mdash;the Mestizos, from Europeans and American
indigenes&mdash;the Zambos, from these American indigenes and
Negroes, &amp;c., are permanently fertile. They practically constitute
sub-races, with a general blending of the characters of
the two parents, and only differing from fully-established races
in more or less tendency to revert to one or other of the original
types. It has been argued, on the other hand, that not all such
mixed breeds are permanent, and especially that the cross
between Europeans and Australian indigenes is almost sterile;
but this assertion, when examined with the care demanded by
its bearing on the general question of hybridity, has distinctly
broken down. On the whole, the general evidence favours
the opinion that any two races may combine to produce a new
sub-race, which again may combine with any other variety.
Thus, if the existence of a small number of distinct races of
mankind be taken as a starting-point, it is obvious that their
crossing would produce an indefinite number of secondary
varieties, such as the population of the world actually presents.
The working out in detail of the problem, how far the differences
among complex nations, such as those of Europe, may have been
brought about by hybridity, is still, however, a task of almost
hopeless intricacy. Among the boldest attempts to account
for distinctly-marked populations as resulting from the intermixture
of two races, are Huxley&rsquo;s view that the Hottentots
are hybrid between the Bushmen and the Negroes, and his more
important suggestion, that the Melanochroic peoples of southern
Europe are of mixed Xanthochroic and Australioid stock.</p>

<p>The problem of ascertaining how the small number of races,
distinct enough to be called primary, can have assumed their
different types, has been for years the most disputed field of
anthropology, the battle-ground of the rival schools of monogenists
and polygenists. The one has claimed all mankind to
be descended from one original stock, and generally from a single
pair; the other has contended for the several primary races
being separate species of independent origin. The great problem
of the monogenist theory is to explain by what course of variation
the so different races of man have arisen from a single stock.
In ancient times little difficulty was felt in this, authorities
such as Aristotle and Vitruvius seeing in climate and circumstance
the natural cause of racial differences, the Ethiopian having been
blackened by the tropical sun, &amp;c. Later and closer observations,
however, have shown such influences to be, at any rate, far
slighter in amount and slower in operation than was once supposed.
A. de Quatrefages brings forward (<i>Unité de l&rsquo;espèce
humaine</i>) his strongest arguments for the variability of races
under change of climate, &amp;c. (<i>action du milieu</i>), instancing the
asserted alteration in complexion, constitution and character
of Negroes in America, and Englishmen in America and Australia.
But although the reality of some such modification is not disputed,
especially as to stature and constitution, its amount is not enough
to upset the counter-proposition of the remarkable permanence
of type displayed by races, ages after they have been transported
to climates extremely different from that of their former home.
Moreover, physically different peoples, such as the Bushmen and
Negroes in Africa, show no signs of approximation under the
influence of the same climate; while, on the other hand, the
coast tribes of Tierra del Fuego and forest tribes of tropical
Brazil continue to resemble one another, in spite of extreme
differences of climate and food. Darwin is moderate in his
estimation of the changes produced on races of man by climate
and mode of life within the range of history (<i>Descent of Man</i>,
part i. ch. 4 and 7). The slightness and slowness of variation
in human races having become known, a great difficulty of the
monogenist theory was seen to lie in the apparent shortness
of the Biblical chronology. Inasmuch as several well-marked
races of mankind, such as the Egyptian, Phoenician, Ethiopian,
&amp;c., were much the same three or four thousand years ago as
now, their variation from a single stock in the course of any like
period could hardly be accounted for without a miracle. This
difficulty the polygenist theory escaped, and in consequence
it gained ground. Modern views have however tended to restore,
though under a new aspect, the doctrine of a single human
stock. The fact that man has existed during a vast period of
time makes it more easy to assume the continuance of very slow
natural variation as having differentiated even the white man
and the Negro among the descendants of a common progenitor.
On the other hand it does not follow necessarily from a theory
of evolution of species that mankind must have descended from
a single stock, for the hypothesis of development admits of the
argument, that several simian species may have culminated in
several races of man. The general tendency of the development
theory, however, is against constituting separate species where
the differences are moderate enough to be accounted for as due
to variation from a single type. Darwin&rsquo;s summing-up of the
evidence as to unity of type throughout the races of mankind
is as distinctly a monogenist argument as those of Blumenbach,
Prichard or Quatrefages&mdash;</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>&ldquo;Although the existing races of man differ in many respects, as
in colour, hair, shape of skull, proportions of the body, &amp;c., yet, if
their whole organization be taken into consideration, they are found
to resemble each other closely in a multitude of points. Many of
these points are of so unimportant, or of so singular a nature, that
it is extremely improbable that they should have been independently
acquired by aboriginally distinct species or races. The same remark
holds good with equal or greater force with respect to the numerous
points of mental similarity between the most distinct races of man....
Now, when naturalists observe a close agreement in numerous
small details of habits, tastes and dispositions between two or more
domestic races, or between nearly allied natural forms, they use this
fact as an argument that all are descended from a common progenitor
who was thus endowed; and, consequently, that all should be classed
under the same species. The same argument may be applied with
much force to the races of man.&rdquo;&mdash;(Darwin, <i>Descent of Man</i>, part i.
ch. 7.)</p>
</div>

<p>The main difficulty of the monogenist school has ever been to
explain how races which have remained comparatively fixed in
type during the long period of history, such as the white man and
the Negro, should, in even a far longer period, have passed by
variation from a common original. To meet this A.R. Wallace
suggests that the remotely ancient representatives of the human
species, being as yet animals too low in mind to have developed
those arts of maintenance and social ordinances by which man
holds his own against influences from climate and circumstance,
were in their then wild state much more plastic than now to
external nature; so that &ldquo;natural selection&rdquo; and other causes
met with but feeble resistance in forming the permanent varieties
or races of man, whose complexion and structure still remained
fixed in their descendants (see Wallace, <i>Contributions to the Theory
of Natural Selection</i>, p. 319). On the whole, it may be asserted
that the doctrine of the unity of mankind stands on a firmer basis
than in previous ages. It would be premature to judge how far
the problem of the origin of races may be capable of exact
solution; but the experience gained since 1871 countenances
Darwin&rsquo;s prophecy that before long the dispute between the
monogenists and the polygenists would die a silent and unobserved
death.</p>

<p>IV. <i>Antiquity of Man.</i>&mdash;Until the 10th century man&rsquo;s first
appearance on earth was treated on a historical basis as matter
of record. It is true that the schemes drawn up by chronologists
differed widely, as was natural, considering the variety and inconsistency
of their documentary data. On the whole, the scheme
of Archbishop Usher, who computed that the earth and man were
created in 4004 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, was the most popular (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chronology</a></span>).
It is no longer necessary, however, to discuss these chronologies.
Geology has made it manifest that our earth must have
been the seat of vegetable and animal life for an immense period
of time; while the first appearance of man, though comparatively
recent, is positively so remote, that an estimate between twenty
and a hundred thousand years may fairly be taken as a minimum.
This geological claim for a vast antiquity of the human race is
supported by the similar claims of prehistoric archaeology and
the science of culture, the evidence of all three departments of
inquiry being intimately connected, and in perfect harmony.</p>

<p>Human bones and objects of human manufacture have been
found in such geological relation to the remains of fossil species
of elephant, rhinoceros, hyena, bear, &amp;c., as to lead to the distinct
inference that man already existed at a remote period in localities
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page115" id="page115"></a>115</span>
where these mammalia are now and have long been extinct. The
not quite conclusive researches of Tournal and Christol in
limestone caverns of the south of France date back to 1828.
About the same time P.C. Schmerling of Liége was exploring
the ossiferous caverns of the valley of the Meuse, and satisfied
himself that the men whose bones he found beneath the stalagmite
floors, together with bones cut and flints shaped by human
workmanship, had inhabited this Belgian district at the same
time with the cave-bear and several other extinct animals whose
bones were imbedded with them (<i>Recherches sur les ossements
fossiles découverts dans les cavernes de la province de Liége</i> (Liége,
1833-1834)). This evidence, however, met with little acceptance
among scientific men. Nor, at first, was more credit given to the
discovery by M. Boucher de Perthes, about 1841, of rude flint
hatchets in a sand-bed containing remains of mammoth and
rhinoceros at Menchecourt near Abbeville, which first find was
followed by others in the same district (see Boucher de Perthes, <i>De
l&rsquo;Industrie primitive, ou les arts à leur origine</i> (1846); <i>Antiquités
celtiques et antédiluviennes</i> (Paris, 1847), &amp;c.). Between 1850 and
1860 French and English geologists were induced to examine into
the facts, and found irresistible the evidence that man existed and
used rude implements of chipped flint during the Quaternary or
Drift period. Further investigations were then made, and overlooked
results of older ones reviewed. In describing Kent&rsquo;s
Cavern (<i>q.v.</i>) near Torquay, R.A.C. Godwin-Austen had maintained,
as early as 1840 (<i>Proc. Geo. Soc. London</i>, vol. iii. p. 286),
that the human bones and worked flints had been deposited indiscriminately
together with the remains of fossil elephant, rhinoceros,
&amp;c. Certain caves and rock-shelters in the province of Dordogne,
in central France, were examined by a French and an English
archaeologist, Edouard Lartet and Henry Christy, the remains
discovered showing the former prevalence of the reindeer in this
region, at that time inhabited by savages, whose bone and stone
implements indicate a habit of life similar to that of the Eskimos.
Moreover, the co-existence of man with a fauna now extinct or confined
to other districts was brought to yet clearer demonstration
by the discovery in these caves of certain drawings and carvings
of the animals done by the ancient inhabitants themselves, such
as a group of reindeer on a piece of reindeer horn, and a sketch
of a mammoth, showing the elephant&rsquo;s long hair, on a piece of a
mammoth&rsquo;s tusk from La Madeleine (Lartet and Christy, <i>Reliquiae
Aquitanicae</i>, ed. by T.R. Jones (London, 1865), &amp;c.).</p>

<p>This and other evidence (which is considered in more detail
in the article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Archaeology</a></span>) is now generally accepted by
geologists as carrying back the existence of man into the period
of the post-glacial drift, in what is now called the Quaternary
period, an antiquity at least of tens of thousands of years. Again,
certain inferences have been tentatively made from the depth of
mud, earth, peat, &amp;c., which has accumulated above relics of
human art imbedded in ancient times. Among these is the
argument from the numerous borings made in the alluvium of
the Nile valley to a depth of 60 ft., where down to the lowest
level fragments of burnt brick and pottery were always found,
showing that people advanced enough in the arts to bake brick
and pottery have inhabited the valley during the long period
required for the Nile inundations to deposit 60 ft. of mud, at a
rate probably not averaging more than a few inches in a century.
Another argument is that of Professor von Morlot, based on a
railway section through a conical accumulation of gravel and
alluvium, which the torrent of the Tinière has gradually built up
where it enters the Lake of Geneva near Villeneuve. Here three
layers of vegetable soil appear, proved by the objects imbedded
in them to have been the successive surface soils in two prehistoric
periods and in the Roman period, but now lying 4, 10
and 19 ft. underground. On this it is computed that if 4 ft. of
soil were formed in the 1500 years since the Roman period, we
must go 5000 years farther back for the date of the earliest human
inhabitants. Calculations of this kind, loose as they are, deserve
attention.</p>

<p>The interval between the Quaternary or Drift period and the
period of historical antiquity is to some extent bridged over by
relics of various intermediate civilizations, <i>e.g.</i> the Lake-dwellings
(<i>q.v.</i>) of Switzerland, mostly of the lower grades, and in some
cases reaching back to remote dates. And further evidence of
man&rsquo;s antiquity is afforded by the kitchen-middens or shell-heaps
(<i>q.v.</i>), especially those in Denmark. Danish peat-mosses again
show the existence of man at a time when the Scotch fir was
abundant; at a later period the firs were succeeded by oaks,
which have again been almost superseded by beeches, a succession
of changes which indicate a considerable lapse of time.</p>

<p>Lastly, chronicles and documentary records, taken in connexion
with archaeological relics of the historical period, carry
back into distant ages the starting-point of actual history, behind
which lies the evidently vast period only known by inferences
from the relations of languages and the stages of development of
civilization. The most recent work of Egyptologists proves a
systematic civilization to have existed in the valley of the Nile
at least 6000 to 7000 years ago (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Chronology</a></span>).</p>

<p>It was formerly held that the early state of society was one of
comparatively high culture, and thus there was no hesitation in
assigning the origin of man to a time but little beyond the range
of historical records and monuments. But the researches of
anthropologists in recent years have proved that the civilization
of man has been gradually developed from an original stone-age
culture, such as characterizes modern savage life. To the 6000
years to which ancient civilization dates back must be added a
vast period during which the knowledge, arts and institutions of
such a civilization as that of ancient Egypt attained the high
level evidenced by the earliest records. The evidence of comparative
philology supports the necessity for an enormous time
allowance. Thus, Hebrew and Arabic are closely related
languages, neither of them the original of the other, but both
sprung from some parent language more ancient than either.
When, therefore, the Hebrew records have carried back to the
most ancient admissible date the existence of the Hebrew
language, this date must have been long preceded by that of
the extinct parent language of the whole Semitic family; while
this again was no doubt the descendant of languages slowly
shaping themselves through ages into this peculiar type. Yet
more striking is the evidence of the Indo-European (formerly
called Aryan) family of languages. The Hindus, Medes, Persians,
Greeks, Romans, Germans, Celts and Slavs make their appearance
at more or less remote dates as nations separate in language
as in history. Nevertheless, it is now acknowledged that at
some far remoter time, before these nations were divided from
the parent stock, and distributed over Asia and Europe, a single
barbaric people stood as physical and political representative
of the nascent Aryan race, speaking a now extinct Aryan language,
from which, by a series of modifications not to be estimated
as possible within many thousands of years, there arose languages
which have been mutually unintelligible since the dawn of history,
and between which it was only possible for an age of advanced
philology to trace the fundamental relationship.</p>

<p>From the combination of these considerations, it will be seen
that the farthest date to which documentary or other records
extend is now generally regarded by anthropologists as but the
earliest distinctly visible point of the historic period, beyond
which stretches back a vast indefinite series of prehistoric ages.</p>

<p>V. <i>Language.</i>&mdash;In examining how the science of language
bears on the general problems of anthropology, it is not necessary
to discuss at length the critical questions which arise, the principal
of which are considered elsewhere (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Language</a></span>). Philology is
especially appealed to by anthropologists as contributing to the
following lines of argument. A primary mental similarity of all
branches of the human race is evidenced by their common
faculty of speech, while at the same time secondary diversities
of race-character and history are marked by difference of grammatical
structure and of vocabularies. The existence of groups
or families of allied languages, each group being evidently
descended from a single language, affords one of the principal
aids in classifying nations and races. The adoption by one
language of words originally belonging to another, proving as it
does the fact of intercourse between two races, and even to some
extent indicating the results of such intercourse, affords a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page116" id="page116"></a>116</span>
valuable clue through obscure regions of the history of
civilization.</p>

<p>Communication by gesture-signs, between persons unable to
converse in vocal language, is an effective system of expression
common to all mankind. Thus, the signs used to ask a deaf and
dumb child about his meals and lessons, or to communicate with
a savage met in the desert about game or enemies, belong to
codes of gesture-signals identical in principle, and to a great
extent independent both of nationality and education; there is
even a natural syntax, or order of succession, in such gesture-signs.
To these gestures let there be added the use of the
interjectional cries, such as <i>oh! ugh! hey!</i> and imitative sounds
to represent the cat&rsquo;s <i>mew</i>, the <i>click</i> of a trigger, the <i>clap</i> or <i>thud</i>
of a blow, &amp;c. The total result of this combination of gesture
and significant sound will be a general system of expression,
imperfect but serviceable, and naturally intelligible to all mankind
without distinction of race. Nor is such a system of
communication only theoretically conceivable; it is, and always
has been, in practical operation between people ignorant of one
another&rsquo;s language, and as such is largely used in the intercourse
of savage tribes. It is true that to some extent these means of
utterance are common to the lower animals, the power of expressing
emotion by cries and tones extending far down in the
scale of animal life, while rudimentary gesture-signs are made by
various mammals and birds. Still, the lower animals make no
approach to the human system of natural utterance by gesture-signs
and emotional-imitative sounds, while the practical
identity of this human system among races physically so unlike
as the Englishman and the native of the Australian bush
indicates extreme closeness of mental similarity throughout the
human species.</p>

<p>When, however, the Englishman and the Australian speak
each in his native tongue, only such words as belong to the
interjectional and imitative classes will be naturally intelligible,
and as it were instinctive to both. Thus the savage, uttering
the sound <i>waow!</i> as an explanation of surprise and warning,
might be answered by the white man with the not less evidently
significant <i>sh!</i> of silence, and the two speakers would be on
common ground when the native indicated by the name <i>bwirri</i>
his cudgel, flung <i>whirring</i> through the air at a flock of birds, or
when the native described as a <i>jakkal-yakkal</i> the bird called by
the foreigner a <i>cockatoo</i>. With these, and other very limited
classes of natural words, however, resemblance in vocabulary
practically ceases. The Australian and English languages each
consist mainly of a series of words having no apparent connexion
with the ideas they signify, and differing utterly; of course,
accidental coincidences and borrowed words must be excluded
from such comparisons. It would be easy to enumerate other
languages of the world, such as Basque, Turkish, Hebrew, Malay,
Mexican, all devoid of traceable resemblance to Australian and
English, and to one another. There is, moreover, extreme
difference in the grammatical structure both of words and sentences
in various languages. The question then arises, how far
the employment of different vocabularies, and that to a great
extent on different grammatical principles, is compatible with
similarity of the speakers&rsquo; minds, or how far does diversity of
speech indicate diversity of mental nature? The obvious
answer is, that the power of using words as signs to express
thoughts with which their sound does not directly connect them,
in fact as arbitrary symbols, is the highest grade of the special
human faculty in language, the presence of which binds together
all races of mankind in substantial mental unity. The measure
of this unity is, that any child of any race can be brought up to
speak the language of any other race.</p>

<p>Under the present standard of evidence in comparing languages
and tracing allied groups to a common origin, the crude speculations
as to a single primeval language of mankind, which formerly
occupied so much attention, are acknowledged to be worthless.
Increased knowledge and accuracy of method have as yet only
left the way open to the most widely divergent suppositions.
For all that known dialects prove to the contrary, on the one
hand, there may have been one primitive language, from which
the descendant languages have varied so widely, that neither
their words nor their formation now indicate their unity in long
past ages, while, on the other hand, the primitive tongues of
mankind may have been numerous, and the extreme unlikeness
of such languages as Basque, Chinese, Peruvian, Hottentot and
Sanskrit may arise from absolute independence of origin.</p>

<p>The language spoken by any tribe or nation is not of itself
absolute evidence as to its race-affinities. This is clearly shown
in extreme cases. Thus the Jews in Europe have almost lost the
use of Hebrew, but speak as their vernacular the language of
their adopted nation, whatever it may be; even the Jewish-German
dialect, though consisting so largely of Hebrew words,
is philologically German, as any sentence shows: &ldquo;<i>Ich hab noch
hoiom lo geachelt</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;I have not yet eaten to-day.&rdquo; The mixture
of the Israelites in Europe by marriage with other nations is
probably much greater than is acknowledged by them; yet, on
the whole, the race has been preserved with extraordinary
strictness, as its physical characteristics sufficiently show.
Language thus here fails conspicuously as a test of race and even
of national history. Not much less conclusive is the case of the
predominantly Negro populations of the West India Islands,
who, nevertheless, speak as their native tongues dialects of
English or French, in which the number of intermingled native
African words is very scanty: &ldquo;<i>Dem hitti netti na ini watra
bikasi dem de fisiman</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;They cast a net into the water, because
they were fishermen.&rdquo; (Surinam Negro-Eng.) &ldquo;<i>Bef pas ca
jamain lasse poter cônes li</i>,&rdquo; &ldquo;Le boeuf n&rsquo;est jamais las de porter
ses cornes.&rdquo; (Haitian Negro-Fr.) If it be objected that the
linguistic conditions of these two races are more artificial than
has been usual in the history of the world, less extreme cases
may be seen in countries where the ordinary results of conquest-colonization
have taken place. The Mestizos, who form so large
a fraction of the population of modern Mexico, numbering
several millions, afford a convenient test in this respect, inasmuch
as their intermediate complexion separates them from both their
ancestral races, the Spaniard, and the chocolate-brown indigenous
Aztec or other Mexican. The mother-tongue of this mixed race
is Spanish, with an infusion of Mexican words; and a large
proportion cannot speak any native dialect. In most or all
nations of mankind, crossing or intermarriage of races has thus
taken place between the conquering invader and the conquered
native, so that the language spoken by the nation may represent
the results of conquest as much or more than of ancestry. The
supersession of the Celtic Cornish by English, and of the Slavonic
Old-Prussian by German, are but examples of a process which
has for untold ages been supplanting native dialects, whose very
names have mostly disappeared. On the other hand, the
language of the warlike invader or peaceful immigrant may
yield, in a few generations, to the tongue of the mass of the
population, as the Northman&rsquo;s was replaced by French, and
modern German gives way to English in the United States.
Judging, then, by the extirpation and adoption of languages
within the range of history, it is obvious that to classify mankind
into, races, Aryan, Semitic, Turanian, Polynesian, Kaffir, &amp;c.,
on the mere evidence of language, is intrinsically unsound.</p>

<p>VI. <i>Development of Civilization.</i>&mdash;The conditions of man at the
lowest and highest known levels of culture are separated by a
vast interval; but this interval is so nearly filled by known
intermediate stages, that the line of continuity between the
lowest savagery and the highest civilization is unbroken at any
critical point.</p>

<p>An examination of the details of savage life shows not only
that there is an immeasurable difference between the rudest man
and the highest lower animal, but also that the least cultured
savages have themselves advanced far beyond the lowest
intellectual and moral state at which human tribes can be conceived
as capable of existing, when placed under favourable
circumstances of warm climate, abundant food, and security from
too severe destructive influences. The Australian black-fellow
or the forest Indian of Brazil, who may be taken as examples
of the lowest modern savage, had, before contact with whites,
attained to rudimentary stages in many of the characteristic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>117</span>
functions of civilized life. His language, expressing thoughts
by conventional articulate sounds, is the same in essential
principle as the most cultivated philosophic dialect, only less
exact and copious. His weapons, tools and other appliances
such as the hammer, hatchet, spear, knife, awl, thread, net, canoe,
&amp;c., are the evident rudimentary analogues of what still remains
in use among Europeans. His structures, such as the hut, fence,
stockade, earthwork, &amp;c., may be poor and clumsy, but they are of
the same nature as our own. In the simple arts of broiling
and roasting meat, the use of hides and furs for covering, the
plaiting of mats and baskets, the devices of hunting, trapping
and fishing, the pleasure taken in personal ornament, the touches
of artistic decoration on objects of daily use, the savage differs
in degree but not in kind from the civilized man. The domestic
and social affections, the kindly care of the young and the old,
some acknowledgment of marital and parental obligation, the
duty of mutual defence in the tribe, the authority of the elders,
and general respect to traditional custom as the regulator of
life and duty, are more or less well marked in every savage tribe
which is not disorganized and falling to pieces. Lastly, there is
usually to be discerned amongst such lower races a belief in
unseen powers pervading the universe, this belief shaping itself
into an animistic or spiritualistic theology, mostly resulting in
some kind of worship. If, again, high savage or low barbaric
types be selected, as among the North American Indians, Polynesians,
and Kaffirs of South Africa, the same elements of culture
appear, but at a more advanced stage, namely, a more full and
accurate language, more knowledge of the laws of nature, more
serviceable implements, more perfect industrial processes, more
definite and fixed social order and frame of government, more
systematic and philosophic schemes of religion and a more
elaborate and ceremonial worship. At intervals new arts and
ideas appear, such as agriculture and pasturage, the manufacture
of pottery, the use of metal implements and the device of record
and communication by picture writing. Along such stages of
improvement and invention the bridge is fairly made between
savage and barbaric culture; and this once attained to, the
remainder of the series of stages of civilization lies within the
range of common knowledge.</p>

<p>The teaching of history, during the three to four thousand
years of which contemporary chronicles have been preserved,
is that civilization is gradually developed in the course of ages by
enlargement and increased precision of knowledge, invention and
improvement of arts, and the progression of social and political
habits and institutions towards general well-being. That processes
of development similar to these were in prehistoric times
effective to raise culture from the savage to the barbaric level,
two considerations especially tend to prove. First, there are
numerous points in the culture even of rude races which are not
explicable otherwise than on the theory of development. Thus,
though difficult or superfluous arts may easily be lost, it is
hard to imagine the abandonment of contrivances of practical
daily utility, where little skill is required and materials are easily
accessible. Had the Australians or New Zealanders, for instance,
ever possessed the potter&rsquo;s art, they could hardly have forgotten
it. The inference that these tribes represent the stage of culture
before the invention of pottery is confirmed by the absence of
buried fragments of pottery in the districts they inhabit. The
same races who were found making thread by the laborious process
of twisting with the hand, would hardly have disused, if they had
ever possessed, so simple a labour-saving device as the spindle,
which consists merely of a small stick weighted at one end; the
spindle may, accordingly, be regarded as an instrument invented
somewhere between the lowest and highest savage levels (Tylor,
<i>Early Hist. of Mankind</i>, p. 193). Again, many devices of civilization
bear unmistakable marks of derivation from a lower source;
thus the ancient Egyptian and Assyrian harps, which differ from
ours in having no front pillar, appear certainly to owe this remarkable
defect to having grown up through intermediate
forms from the simple strung bow, the still used type of the most
primitive stringed instrument. In this way the history of
numeral words furnishes actual proof of that independent intellectual
progress among savage tribes which some writers have
rashly denied. Such words as <i>hand, hands, foot, man</i>, &amp;c., are
used as numerals signifying 5, 10, 15, 20, &amp;c., among many
savage and barbaric peoples; thus Polynesian <i>lima</i>, <i>i.e.</i>
&ldquo;hand,&rdquo; means 5; Zulu <i>tatisitupa</i>, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;taking the thumb,&rdquo;
means 6; Greenlandish <i>arfersanek-pingasut</i>, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;on the other
foot three,&rdquo; means 18; Tamanac <i>tevin itoto</i>, <i>i.e.</i> &ldquo;one man,&rdquo;
means 20, &amp;c., &amp;c. The existence of such expressions demonstrates
that the people who use them had originally no spoken
names for these numbers, but once merely counted them by
gesture on their fingers and toes in low savage fashion, till they
obtained higher numerals by the inventive process of describing
in words these counting-gestures. Second, the process of
&ldquo;survival in culture&rdquo; has caused the preservation in each stage
of society of phenomena, belonging to an earlier period, but kept
up by force of custom into the later, thus supplying evidence of
the modern condition being derived from the ancient. Thus the
mitre over an English bishop&rsquo;s coat-of-arms is a survival which
indicates him as the successor of bishops who actually wore
mitres, while armorial bearings themselves, and the whole craft
of heraldry, are survivals bearing record of a state of warfare and
social order whence our present state was by vast modification
evolved. Evidence of this class, proving the derivation of
modern civilization, not only from ancient barbarism, but beyond
this, from primeval savagery, is immensely plentiful, especially in
rites and ceremonies, where the survival of ancient habits is
peculiarly favoured. Thus the modern Hindu, though using
civilized means for lighting his household fires, retains the savage
&ldquo;fire-drill&rdquo; for obtaining fire by friction of wood when what he
considers pure or sacred fire has to be produced for sacrificial
purposes; while in Europe into modern times the same primitive
process has been kept up in producing the sacred and magical
&ldquo;need-fire,&rdquo; which was lighted to deliver cattle from a murrain.
Again, the funeral offerings of food, clothing, weapons, &amp;c., to
the dead are absolutely intelligible and purposeful among savage
races, who believe that the souls of the departed are ethereal
beings capable of consuming food, and of receiving and using
the souls or phantoms of any objects sacrificed for their use. The
primitive philosophy to which these conceptions belong has to a
great degree been discredited by modern science; yet the clear
survivals of such ancient and savage rites may still be seen in
Europe, where the Bretons leave the remains of the All Souls&rsquo;
supper on the table for the ghosts of the dead kinsfolk to partake
of, and Russian peasants set out cakes for the ancestral manes
on the ledge which supports the holy pictures, and make
dough ladders to assist the ghosts of the dead to ascend out of
their graves and start on their journey for the future world;
while other provision for the same spiritual journey is made
when the coin is still put in the hand of the corpse at an Irish
wake. In like manner magic still exists in the civilized world
as a survival from the savage and barbaric times to which it
originally belongs, and in which is found the natural source
and proper home of utterly savage practices still carried on by
ignorant peasants in Great Britain, such as taking omens from
the cries of animals, or bewitching an enemy by sticking full of
pins and hanging up to shrivel in the smoke an image or other
object, that similar destruction may fall on the hated person
represented by the symbol (Tylor, <i>Primitive Culture</i>, ch. i., iii.,
iv., xi., xii.; <i>Early Hist. of Man</i>, ch. vi.).</p>

<p>The comparative science of civilization thus not only
generalizes the data of history, but supplements its information
by laying down the lines of development along which the lowest
prehistoric culture has gradually risen to the highest modern
level. Among the most clearly marked of these lines is that which
follows the succession of the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages (see
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Archaeology</a></span>). The Stone Age represents the early condition
of mankind in general, and has remained in savage districts up to
modern times, while the introduction of metals need not at once
supersede the use of the old stone hatchets and arrows, which
have often long continued in dwindling survival by the side of the
new bronze and even iron ones. The Bronze Age had its most
important place among ancient nations of Asia and Europe, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page118" id="page118"></a>118</span>
among them was only succeeded after many centuries by the
Iron Age; while in other districts, such as Polynesia and Central
and South Africa, and America (except Mexico and Peru), the
native tribes were moved directly from the Stone to the Iron
Age without passing through the Bronze Age at all. Although
the three divisions of savage, barbaric, and civilized man do not
correspond at all perfectly with the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages,
this classification of civilization has proved of extraordinary
value in arranging in their proper order of culture the nations of
the Old World.</p>

<p>Another great line of progress has been followed by tribes
passing from the primitive state of the wild hunter, fisher and
fruit-gatherer to that of the settled tiller of the soil, for to
this change of habit may be plainly in great part traced
the expansion of industrial arts and the creation of higher
social and political institutions. These, again, have followed
their proper lines along the course of time. Among such is
the immense legal development by which the primitive law
of personal vengeance passed gradually away, leaving but a
few surviving relics in the modern civilized world, and being
replaced by the higher doctrine that crime is an offence against
society, to be repressed for the public good. Another vast
social change has been that from the patriarchal condition, in
which the unit is the family under the despotic rule of its head,
to the systems in which individuals make up a society whose
government is centralized in a chief or king. In the growth of
systematic civilization, the art of writing has had an influence so
intense, that of all tests to distinguish the barbaric from the
civilized state, none is so generally effective as this, whether they
have but the failing link with the past which mere memory
furnishes, or can have recourse to written records of past history
and written constitutions of present order. Lastly, still following
the main lines of human culture, the primitive germs of religious
institutions have to be traced in the childish faith and rude rites
of savage life, and thence followed in their expansion into the
vast systems administered by patriarchs and priests, henceforth
taking under their charge the precepts of morality, and enforcing
them under divine sanction, while also exercising in political
life an authority beside or above the civil law.</p>

<p>The state of culture reached by Quaternary man is evidenced
by the stone implements in the drift-gravels, and other relics
of human art in the cave deposits. His drawings on bone or
tusk found in the caves show no mean artistic power, as appears
by the three specimens copied in the Plate. That representing
two deer (fig. 6) was found so early as 1852 in the breccia of a
limestone cave on the Charente, and its importance recognized
in a remarkable letter by Prosper Merimée, as at once historically
ancient and geologically modern (<i>Congrès d&rsquo;anthropologie et
d&rsquo;archéologie préhistoriques</i>, Copenhagen (1869), p. 128). The
other two are the famous mammoth from the cave of La
Madeleine, on which the woolly mane and huge tusks of <i>Elephas
primigenius</i> are boldly drawn (fig. 7); and the group of man and
horses (fig. 8). There has been found one other contemporary
portrait of man, where a hunter is shown stalking an aurochs.</p>

<p>That the men of the Quaternary period knew the savage
art of producing fire by friction, and roasted the flesh on which
they mainly subsisted, is proved by the fragments of charcoal
found in the cave deposits, where also occur bone awls and
needles, which indicate the wearing of skin clothing, like that of
the modern Australians and Fuegians. Their bone lance-heads
and dart-points were comparable to those of northern and southern
savages. Particular attention has to be given to the stone
implements used by these earliest known of mankind. The
division of tribes in the stone implement stage into two classes,
the Palaeolithic or Old Stone Age, and the Neolithic or New
Stone Age, according to their proficiency in this most important
art furnishes in some respects the best means of determining
their rank in general culture.</p>

<p>In order to put this argument clearly before the reader, a few
selected implements are figured in the Plate. The group in
fig. 9 contains tools and weapons of the Neolithic period such
as are dug up on European soil; they are evident relics of
ancient populations who used them till replaced by metal.
The stone hatchets are symmetrically shaped and edged by
grinding, while the cutting flakes, scrapers, spear and arrow
heads are of high finish. Direct knowledge of the tribes who
made them is scanty, but implements so similar in make and
design having been in use in North and South America until
modern times, it may be assumed for purposes of classification
that the Neolithic peoples of the New World were at a similar
barbarous level in industrial arts, social organization, moral
and religious ideas. Such comparison, though needing caution
and reserve, at once proved of great value to anthropology.
When, however, there came to light from the drift-gravels
and limestone caves of Europe the Palaeolithic implements,
of which some types are shown in the group (fig. 10), the difficult
problem presented itself, what degree of general culture these
rude implements belonged to. On mere inspection, their rudeness,
their unsuitability for being hafted, and the absence of
shaping and edging by the grindstone, mark their inferiority
to the Neolithic implements. Their immensely greater antiquity
was proved by their geological position and their association
with a long extinct fauna, and they were not, like the Neoliths,
recognizable as corresponding closely to the implements used
by modern tribes. There was at first a tendency to consider
the Palaeoliths as the work of men ruder than savages, if,
indeed, their makers were to be accounted human at all. Since
then, however, the problem has passed into a more manageable
state. Stone implements, more or less approaching the European
Palaeolithic type, were found in Africa from Egypt southwards,
where in such parts as Somaliland and Cape Colony they lie about
on the ground, as though they had been the rough tools and
weapons of the rude inhabitants of the land at no very distant
period. The group in fig. 11 in the Plate shows the usual Somaliland
types. These facts tended to remove the mystery from
Palaeolithic man, though too little is known of the ruder ancient
tribes of Africa to furnish a definition of the state of culture
which might have co-existed with the use of Palaeolithic implements.
Information to this purpose, however, can now be
furnished from a more outlying region. This is Tasmania, where
as in the adjacent continent of Australia, the survival of marsupial
animals indicates long isolation from the rest of the world.
Here, till far on into the 19th century, the Englishmen could
watch the natives striking off flakes of stone, trimming them to
convenient shape for grasping them in the hand, and edging
them by taking off successive chips on one face only. The group
in fig. 12 shows ordinary Tasmanian forms, two of them being
finer tools for scraping and grooving. (For further details
reference may be made to H. Ling Roth, <i>The Tasmanians</i>,
(2nd ed., 1899); R. Brough Smyth, <i>Aborigines of Victoria</i> (1878),
vol. ii.; <i>Papers and Proceedings of Royal Society of Tasmania</i>;
and papers by the present writer in <i>Journal of the Anthropological
Institute</i>.) The Tasmanians, when they came in contact with the
European explorers and settlers, were not the broken outcasts
they afterwards became. They were a savage people, perhaps
the lowest in culture of any known, but leading a normal,
self-supporting, and not unhappy life, which had probably changed
little during untold ages. The accounts, imperfect as they
are, which have been preserved of their arts, beliefs and habits,
thus present a picture of the arts, beliefs and habits of tribes
whose place in the Stone Age was a grade lower than that of
Palaeolithic man of the Quaternary period.</p>

<p>The Tasmanian stone implements, figured in the Plate, show
their own use when it is noticed that the rude chipping forms
a good hand-grip above, and an effective edge for chopping,
sawing, and cutting below. But the absence of the long-shaped
implements, so characteristic of the Neolithic and Palaeolithic
series, and serviceable as picks, hatchets, and chisels, shows remarkable
limitation in the mind of these savages, who made
a broad, hand-grasped knife their tool of all work to cut, saw, and
chop with. Their weapons were the wooden club or waddy
notched to the grasp, and spears of sticks, often crooked but well
balanced, with points sharpened by tool or fire, and sometimes
jagged. No spear thrower or bow and arrow was known. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page119" id="page119"></a>119</span>
Tasmanian savages were crafty warriors and kangaroo-hunters,
and the women climbed the highest trees by notching, in quest
of opossums. Shell-fish and crabs were taken, and seals knocked
on the head with clubs, but neither fish-hook nor fishing-net was
known, and indeed swimming fish were taboo as food. Meat
and vegetable food, such as fern-root, was broiled over the fire,
but boiling in a vessel was unknown. The fire was produced
by the ordinary savage fire-drill. Ignorant of agriculture,
with no dwellings but rough huts or breakwinds of sticks and
bark, without dogs or other domestic animals, these savages,
until the coming of civilized man, roamed after food within their
tribal bounds. Logs and clumsy floats of bark and grass enabled
them to cross water under favourable circumstances. They
had clothing of skins rudely stitched together with bark thread,
and they were decorated with simple necklaces of kangaroo
teeth, shells and berries. Among their simple arts, plaiting
and basket-work was one in which they approached the civilized
level. The pictorial art of the Tasmanians was poor and childish,
quite below that of the Palaeolithic men of Europe. The
Tasmanians spoke a fairly copious agglutinating language,
well marked as to parts of speech, syntax and inflexion. Numeration
was at a low level, based on counting fingers on one hand
only, so that the word for man (<i>puggana</i>) stood also for the
number 5. The religion of the Tasmanians, when cleared from
ideas apparently learnt from the whites, was a simple form of
animism based on the shadow (<i>warrawa</i>) being the soul or spirit.
The strongest belief of the natives was in the power of the ghosts
of the dead, so that they carried the bones of relatives to secure
themselves from harm, and they fancied the forest swarming
with malignant demons. They placed weapons near the grave
for the dead friend&rsquo;s soul to use, and drove out disease from the
sick by exorcising the ghost which was supposed to have caused
it. Of greater special spirits of Nature we find something
vaguely mentioned. The earliest recorders of the native social
life set down such features as their previous experience of rude
civilized life had made them judges of. They notice the self-denying
affection of the mothers, and the hard treatment of
the wives by the husbands, polygamy and the shifting marriage
unions. But when we meet with a casual remark as to the
tendency of the Tasmanians to take wives from other tribes
than their own, it seems likely that they had some custom of
exogamy which the foreigners did not understand. Meagre
as is the information preserved of the arts, thoughts, and customs
of these survivors from the lower Stone Age, it is of value as
furnishing even a temporary and tentative means of working
out the development of culture on a basis not of conjecture
but of fact.</p>

<p><i>Conclusion.</i>&mdash;To-day anthropology is grappling with the heavy
task of systematizing the vast stores of knowledge to which the
key was found by Boucher de Perthes, by Lartet, Christy and
their successors. There have been recently no discoveries to
rival in novelty those which followed the exploration of the bone-caves
and drift-gravels, and which effected an instant revolution
in all accepted theories of man&rsquo;s antiquity, substituting for a
chronology of centuries a vague computation of hundreds of
thousands of years. The existence of man in remote geological
time cannot now be questioned, but, despite much effort made in
likely localities, no bones, with the exception of those of the
much-discussed <i>Pithecanthropus</i>, have been found which can
be regarded as definitely bridging the gulf between man and the
lower creation. It seems as if anthropology had in this direction
reached the limits of its discoveries. Far different are the
prospects in other directions where the work of co-ordinating the
material and facts collected promises to throw much light on the
history of civilization. Anthropological researches undertaken
all over the globe have shown the necessity of abandoning the old
theory that a similarity of customs and superstitions, of arts and
crafts, justifies the assumption of a remote relationship, if not
an identity of origin, between races. It is now certain that there
has ever been an inherent tendency in man, allowing for difference
of climate and material surroundings, to develop culture by the
same stages and in the same way. American man, for example,
need not necessarily owe the minutest portion of his mental,
religious, social or industrial development to remote contact
with Asia or Europe, though he were proved to possess identical
usages. An example in point is that of pyramid-building. No
ethnical relationship can ever have existed between the Aztecs
and the Egyptians; yet each race developed the idea of the
pyramid tomb through that psychological similarity which is as
much a characteristic of the species man as is his physique.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTHROPOMETRY<a name="ar104" id="ar104"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="anthropos">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span>, man, and <span class="grk" title="metron">&#956;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#957;</span>, measure),
the name given by the French savant, Alphonse Bertillon
(b. 1853), to a system of identification (<i>q.v.</i>) depending on the
unchanging character of certain measurements of parts of the
human frame. He found by patient inquiry that several physical
features and the dimensions of certain bones or bony structures
in the body remain practically constant during adult life. He
concluded from this that when these measurements were made
and recorded systematically every single individual would
be found to be perfectly distinguishable from others. The
system was soon adapted to police methods, as the immense value
of being able to fix a person&rsquo;s identity was fully realized, both
in preventing false personation and in bringing home to any one
charged with an offence his responsibility for previous wrongdoing.
&ldquo;Bertillonage,&rdquo; as it was called, became widely popular,
and after its introduction into France in 1883, where it was soon
credited with highly gratifying results, was applied to the
administration of justice in most civilized countries. England
followed tardily, and it was not until 1894 that an investigation
of the methods used and results obtained was made by a special
committee sent to Paris for the purpose. It reported favourably,
especially on the use of the measurements for primary classification,
but recommended also the adoption in part of a system of
&ldquo;finger prints&rdquo; as suggested by Francis Galton, and already
practised in Bengal.</p>

<p>M. Bertillon selected the following five measurements as the
basis of his system: (1) head length; (2) head breadth; (3)
length of middle finger; (4) of left foot, and (5) of cubit or forearm
from the elbow to the extremity of the middle finger. Each
principal heading was further subdivided into three classes of
&ldquo;small,&rdquo; &ldquo;medium&rdquo; and &ldquo;large,&rdquo; and as an increased guarantee
height, length of little finger, and the colour of the eye were also
recorded. From this great mass of details, soon represented in
Paris by the collection of some 100,000 cards, it was possible,
proceeding by exhaustion, to sift and sort down the cards till a
small bundle of half a dozen produced the combined facts of the
measurements of the individual last sought. The whole of the
information is easily contained in one cabinet of very ordinary
dimensions, and most ingeniously contrived so as to make the
most of the space and facilitate the search. The whole of the
record is independent of names, and the final identification is by
means of the photograph which lies with the individual&rsquo;s card of
measurements.</p>

<p>Anthropometry, however, gradually fell into disfavour, and
it has been generally supplanted by the superior system of finger
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page120" id="page120"></a>120</span>
prints (<i>q.v.</i>). Bertillonage exhibited certain defects which were
first brought to light in Bengal. The objections raised were (1)
the costliness of the instruments employed and their liability to
get out of order; (2) the need for specially instructed measurers,
men of superior education; (3) the errors that frequently crept
in when carrying out the processes and were all but irremediable.
Measures inaccurately taken, or wrongly read off, could seldom,
if ever, be corrected, and these persistent errors defeated all
chance of successful search. The process was slow, as it was
necessary to repeat it three times so as to arrive at a mean
result. In Bengal measurements were already abandoned by
1897, when the finger print system was adopted throughout
British India. Three years later England followed suit; and
as the result of a fresh inquiry ordered by the Home Office,
finger prints were alone relied upon for identification.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTHROPOMORPHISM<a name="ar105" id="ar105"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="anthropos">&#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span>, man, <span class="grk" title="morphae">&#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#942;</span>, form),
the attribution (<i>a</i>) of a human body, or (<i>b</i>) of human qualities
generally, to God or the gods. The word anthropomorphism
is a modern coinage (possibly from 18th century French). The
<i>New English Dictionary</i> is misled by the 1866 reprint of Paul
Bayne on Ephesians when it quotes &ldquo;anthropomorphist&rdquo;
as 17th century English. Seventeenth century editions print
&ldquo;anthropomorphits,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i> anthropomorphites, in sense (<i>a</i>). The
older abstract term is &ldquo;anthropopathy,&rdquo; literally &ldquo;attributing
human feelings,&rdquo; in sense (<i>b</i>).</p>

<p>Early religion, among its many objects of worship, includes
beasts (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Animal-Worship</a></span>), considered, in the more refined
theology of the later Greeks and Romans, as metamorphoses of
the great gods. Similarly we find &ldquo;therianthropic&rdquo; forms&mdash;half
animal, half human&mdash;in Egypt or Assyria-Babylonia. In
contrast with these, it is considered one of the glories of the
Olympian mythology of Greece that it believed in happy manlike
beings (though exempt from death, and using special rarefied
foods, &amp;c.), and celebrated them in statues of the most exquisite
art. Israel shows us animal images, doubtless of a ruder sort,
when Yahweh is worshipped in the northern kingdom under the
image of a steer. (Some scholars think the title &ldquo;mighty one of
Jacob,&rdquo; Psalm cxxxii., 2, 5, <i>et al</i>., <span title="abir">&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1488;</span> as if from <span title="avir">&#1512;&#1489;&#1488;</span> is
really &ldquo;steer&rdquo; <span title="abir">&#1512;&#1497;&#1489;&#1488;</span> &ldquo;of Jacob.&rdquo;) But the higher religion of Israel
inclined to morality more than to art, and forbade image worship
altogether. This prepared the way for the conception of God as
an immaterial Spirit. True mythical anthropomorphisms occur
in early parts of the Old Testament (<i>e.g.</i> Genesis iii. 8, cf. vi. 2),
though in the majority of Old Testament passages such expressions
are merely verbal (<i>e.g.</i> Isaiah lix. 1). In the Christian
Church (and again in early Mahommedanism) simple minds
believed in the corporeal nature of God. Gibbon and other
writers quote from John Cassian the tale of the poor monk, who,
being convinced of his error, burst into tears, exclaiming, &ldquo;You
have taken away my God! I have none now whom I can
worship!&rdquo; According to a fragment of Origen (on Genesis i.
26), Melito of Sardis shared this belief. Many have thought
Melito&rsquo;s work, <span class="grk" title="peri ensomatou theou">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#7984; &#7952;&#957;&#963;&#969;&#956;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166;</span>, must have been a treatise
on the Incarnation; but it is hard to think that Origen could
blunder so. Epiphanius tells of Audaeus of Mesopotamia and
his followers, Puritan sectaries in the 4th century, who were
orthodox except for this belief and for Quartodecimanism
(see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Easter</a></span>). Tertullian, who is sometimes called an anthropomorphist,
stood for the Stoical doctrine, that all reality, even
the divine, is in a sense material.</p>

<p>The reaction against anthropomorphism begins in Greek
philosophy with the satirical spirit of Xenophanes (540 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>),
who puts the case as broadly as any. The &ldquo;greatest God&rdquo;
resembles man &ldquo;neither in form nor in mind.&rdquo; In Judaism&mdash;unless
we should refer to the prophets&rsquo; polemic against images&mdash;a
reaction is due to the introduction of the codified law. God
seemed to grow more remote. The old sacred name Yahweh is
never pronounced; even &ldquo;God&rdquo; is avoided for allusive titles
like &ldquo;heaven&rdquo; or &ldquo;place.&rdquo; Still, amid all this, the God of
Judaism remains a personal, almost a limited, being. In Philo
we see Jewish scruples uniting with others drawn from Greek
philosophy. For, though the quarrel with popular anthropomorphism
was patched up, and the gods of the Pantheon were
described by Stoics and Epicureans as manlike in form, philosophy
nevertheless tended to highly abstract conceptions of
supreme, or real, deity. Philo followed out the line of this tradition
in teaching that God cannot be named. How much exactly
he meant is disputed. The same inheritance of Greek philosophy
appears in the Christian fathers, especially Origen. He names
and condemns the &ldquo;anthropomorphites,&rdquo; who ascribe a human
body to God (on Romans i., <i>sub fin</i>.; Rufinus&rsquo; Latin version).
In Arabian philosophy the reaction sought to deny that God
had any attributes. And, under the influence of Mahommedan
Aristotelianism, the same paralysing speculation found entrance
among the learned Jews of Spain (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Maimonides</a></span>).</p>

<p>Till modern times the philosophical reaction was not carried
out with full vigour. Spinoza (<i>Ethics</i>, i. 15 and 17), representing
here as elsewhere both a Jewish inheritance and a philosophical,
but advancing further, sweeps away all community between
God and man. So later J.G. Fichte and Matthew Arnold (&ldquo;a
magnified and non-natural man&rdquo;),&mdash;strangely, in view of their
strong belief in an objective moral order. For the use of the
<i>word</i> &ldquo;anthropomorphic,&rdquo; or kindred forms, in this new spirit of
condemnation for all conceptions of God as manlike&mdash;sense (<i>b</i>)
noted above&mdash;see J.J. Rousseau in <i>Émile</i> iv. (cited by Littré),&mdash;
<i>Nous sommes pour la plupart de vrais anthropomorphites</i>. Rousseau
is here speaking of the language of Christian theology,&mdash;a
divine Spirit: divine Persons. At the present day this usage
is universal. What it means on the lips of pantheists is plain.
But when theists charge one another with &ldquo;anthropomorphism,&rdquo;
in order to rebuke what they deem unduly manlike conceptions
of God, they stand on slippery ground. All theism implies the
assertion of kinship between man, especially in his moral being,
and God. As a brilliant theologian, B. Duhm, has said, physiomorphism
is the enemy of Christian faith, not anthropomorphism.</p>

<p>The latest extension of the word, proposed in the interests of
philosophy or psychology, uses it of the principle according to
which man is said to interpret all things (not God merely) through
himself. Common-sense intuitionalism would deny that man
does this, attributing to him immediate knowledge of reality.
And idealism in all its forms would say that man, interpreting
through his reason, does rightly, and reaches truth. Even here
then the use of the word is not colourless. It implies blame. It
is the symptom of a philosophy which confines knowledge within
narrow limits, and which, when held by Christians (<i>e.g.</i> Peter
Browne, or H.L. Mansel), believes only in an &ldquo;analogical&rdquo;
knowledge of God.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTICHRIST<a name="ar108" id="ar108"></a></span> (<span class="grk" title="antichristos">&#7936;&#957;&#964;&#943;&#967;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span>). The earliest mention of the
name Antichrist, which was probably first coined in Christian
eschatological literature, is in the Epistles of St John (I. ii. 18,
22, iv. 3; II. 7), and it has since come into universal use. The
conception, paraphrased in this word, of a mighty ruler who will
appear at the end of time, and whose essence will be enmity to
God (Dan. xi. 36; cf. 2 Thess. ii. 4; <span class="grk" title="o antikeimenos">&#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>), is older,
and traceable to Jewish eschatology. Its origin is to be sought
in the first place in the prophecy of Daniel, written at the
beginning of the Maccabean period. The historical figure who
served as a model for the &ldquo;Antichrist&rdquo; was Antiochus IV.
Epiphanes, the persecutor of the Jews, and he has impressed
indelible traits upon the conception. Since then ever-recurring
characteristics of this figure (cf. especially Dan xi. 40, &amp;c.) are,
that he would appear as a mighty ruler at the head of gigantic
armies, that he would destroy three rulers (the three horns,
Dan. vii. 8, 24), persecute the saints (vii. 25), rule for three and a
half years (vii. 25, &amp;c.), and subject the temple of God to a
horrible devastation (<span class="grk" title="bdelugma tes eremoseos">&#946;&#948;&#941;&#955;&#965;&#947;&#956;&#945; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7952;&#961;&#951;&#956;&#8032;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;</span>). When the end
of the world foretold by Daniel did not take place, but the book
of Daniel retained its validity as a sacred scripture which foretold
future things, the personality of the tyrant who was God&rsquo;s enemy
disengaged itself from that of Antiochus IV., and became merely
a figure of prophecy, which was applied now to one and now to
another historical phenomenon. Thus for the author of the
<i>Psalms of Solomon</i> (<i>c.</i> 60 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Pompey, who destroyed the
independent rule of the Maccabees and stormed Jerusalem, was
the Adversary of God (cf. ii. 26, &amp;c.); so too the tyrant whom
the <i>Ascension of Moses</i> (<i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 30) expects at the end of all
things, possesses, besides the traits of Antiochus IV., those of
Herod the Great. A further influence on the development of the
eschatological imagination of the Jews was exercised by such a
figure as that of the emperor Caligula (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 37-41), who is known
to have given the order, never carried out, to erect his statue in
the temple of Jerusalem. In the little Jewish Apocalypse, the
existence of which is assumed by many scholars, which in Mark
xiii. and Matt. xxiv. is combined with the words of Christ to
form the great eschatological discourse, the prophecy of the
&ldquo;abomination of desolation&rdquo; (Mark xiii. 14 et seq.) may have
originated in this episode of Jewish history. Later Jewish and
Christian writers of Apocalypses saw in Nero the tyrant of the
end of time. The author of the Syriac <i>Apocalypse of Baruch</i> (or
his source), cap. 36-40, speaks in quite general terms of the last
ruler of the end of time. In 4 Ezra v. 6 also is found the allusion:
<i>regnabit quem non sperant</i>.</p>

<p>The roots of this eschatological fancy are to be sought perhaps
still deeper in a purely mythological and speculative expectation
of a battle at the end of days between God and the devil, which
has no reference whatever to historical occurrences. This idea
has its original source in the apocalypses of Iran, for these are
based upon the conflict between Ahura-Mazda (Auramazda,
Ormazd) and Angro-Mainyush (Ahriman) and its consummation
at the end of the world. This Iranian dualism is proved
to have penetrated into the late Jewish eschatology from the
beginning of the 1st century before Christ, and did so probably
still earlier. Thus the opposition between God and the devil
already plays a part in the Jewish groundwork of the <i>Testaments
of the Patriarchs</i>, which was perhaps composed at the end of
the period of the Maccabees. In this the name of the devil
appears, besides the usual form (<span class="grk" title="satanas, diabolos">&#963;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#957;&#8118;&#962;, &#948;&#953;&#940;&#946;&#959;&#955;&#959;&#962;</span>),
especially as Belial (Beliar, probably, from Ps. xviii. 4, where
the rivers of Belial are spoken of, originally a god of the underworld),
a name which also plays a part in the Antichrist tradition.
In the <i>Ascension of Moses</i> we already hear, at the beginning of
the description of the latter time (x. 1): &ldquo;And then will God&rsquo;s
rule be made manifest over all his creatures, then will the devil
have an end&rdquo; (cf. Matt. xii. 28; Luke xi. 20; John xii. 31,
xiv. 30, xvi. 11).<a name="fa1f" id="fa1f" href="#ft1f"><span class="sp">1</span></a>  This conception of the strife of God with the
devil was further interwoven, before its introduction into the
Antichrist myth, with another idea of different origin, namely,
the myth derived from the Babylonian religion, of the battle
of the supreme God (Marduk) with the dragon of chaos (Tiamat),
originally a myth of the origin of things which, later perhaps,
was changed into an eschatological one, again under Iranian
influence.<a name="fa2f" id="fa2f" href="#ft2f"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Thus it comes that the devil, the opponent of God,
appears in the end often also in the form of a terrible dragon-monster;
this appears most clearly in Rev. xii. Now it is
possible that the whole conception of Antichrist has its final
roots in this already complicated myth, that the form of the
mighty adversary of God is but the equivalent in human form
of the devil or of the dragon of chaos. In any case, however,
this myth has exercised a formative influence on the conception
of Antichrist. For only thus can we explain how his figure
acquires numerous superhuman and ghostly traits, which cannot
be explained by any particular historical phenomenon on which
it may have been based. Thus the figure of Antiochus IV.
has already become superhuman, when in Dan. viii. 10, it is said
that the little horn &ldquo;waxed great, even to the host of heaven;
and cast down some of the host and of the stars to the ground.&rdquo;
Similarly Pompey, in the second psalm of Solomon, is obviously
represented as the dragon of chaos, and his figure exalted into
myth. Without this assumption of a continual infusion of mythological
conceptions, we cannot understand the figure of Antichrist.
Finally, it must be mentioned that Antichrist receives,
at least in the later sources, the name originally proper to the
devil himself.<a name="fa3f" id="fa3f" href="#ft3f"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>From the Jews, Christianity took over the idea. It is present
quite unaltered in certain passages, specifically traceable to
Judaism, <i>e.g.</i> (Rev. xi.). &ldquo;The Beast that ascendeth out of
the bottomless pit&rdquo; and, surrounded by a mighty host of nations,
slays the &ldquo;two witnesses&rdquo; in Jerusalem, is the entirely superhuman
Jewish conception of Antichrist. Even if the beast
(ch. xiii.), which rises from the sea at the summons of the devil,
be interpreted as the Roman empire, and, specially, as any
particular Roman ruler, yet the original form of the malevolent
tyrant of the latter time is completely preserved.</p>

<p>A fundamental change of the whole idea from the specifically
Christian point of view, then, is signified by the conclusion of
ch. ii. of the Second Epistle to the Thessalonians.<a name="fa4f" id="fa4f" href="#ft4f"><span class="sp">4</span></a> There can,
of course, be no doubt as to the identity of the &ldquo;man of sin,
the son of perdition&rdquo; here described with the dominating figure
of Jewish eschatology (cf. ii. 3 &amp;c., <span class="grk" title="o anthropos tes anomias">&#8001; &#7940;&#957;&#952;&#961;&#969;&#960;&#959;&#962; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#7936;&#957;&#959;&#956;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span>,
<i>i.e.</i> Beliar (?), <span class="grk" title="o antikeimenos">&#8001; &#7936;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#949;&#943;&#956;&#949;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>&mdash;the allusion that follows to
Dan xi. 36). But Antichrist here appears as a tempter, who
works by signs and wonders (ii. 9) and seeks to obtain divine
honours; it is further signified that this &ldquo;man of sin&rdquo; will
obtain credence, more especially among the Jews, because they
have not accepted the truth. The conception, moreover, has
become almost more superhuman than ever (cf. ii. 4, &ldquo;showing
himself that he is God&rdquo;). The destruction of the Adversary
is drawn from Isaiah xi. 4, where it is said of the Messiah: &ldquo;with
the breath of his lips shall he slay the wicked.&rdquo;<a name="fa5f" id="fa5f" href="#ft5f"><span class="sp">5</span></a> The idea that
Antichrist was to establish himself in the temple of Jerusalem
(ii. 4) is very enigmatical, and has not yet been explained.
The &ldquo;abomination of desolation&rdquo; has naturally had its influence
upon it; possibly also the experience of the time of Caligula
(see above). Remarkable also is the allusion to a power which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page122" id="page122"></a>122</span>
still retards the revelation of Antichrist (2 Thess. ii. 6 &amp;c.,
<span class="grk" title="to katechon; o katechon">&#964;&#8056; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#967;&#959;&#957;; &#8001; &#954;&#945;&#964;&#941;&#967;&#969;&#957;</span>), an allusion which, in the tradition of
the Fathers of the church, came to be universally, and probably
correctly, referred to the Roman empire. In this then consists
the significant turn given by St Paul in the Second Epistle to the
Thessalonians to the whole conception, namely, in the substitution
for the tyrant of the latter time who should persecute the
Jewish people, of a pseudo-Messianic figure, who, establishing
himself in the temple of God, should find credence and a following
precisely among the Jews. And while the originally Jewish
idea led straight to the conception, set forth in Revelation,
of the Roman empire or its ruler as Antichrist, here, on the contrary,
it is probably the Roman empire that is the power which
still retards the reign of Antichrist. With this, the expectation
of such an event at last separates itself from any connexion with
historical fact, and becomes purely ideal. In this process of
transformation of the idea, which has become of importance for
the history of the world, is revealed probably the genius of Paul,
or at any rate, that of the young Christianity which was breaking
its ties with Judaism and establishing itself in the world of the
Roman empire.</p>

<p>This version of the figure of Antichrist, who may now really
for the first time be described by this name, appears to have been
at once widely accepted in Christendom. The idea that the
Jews would believe in Antichrist, as punishment for not having
believed in the true Christ, seems to be expressed by the author
of the fourth gospel (v. 43). The conception of Antichrist as a
perverter of men, leads naturally to his connexion with false
doctrine (1 John ii. 18, 22; iv. 3; 2 John 7).  The <i>Teaching of
the Apostles</i> (xvi. 4) describes his form in the same way as
2 Thessalonians (<span class="grk" title="kai tote phainaesetai o kosmoplanos os uios
theoy kai poiei saemeia kai terata">&#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#972;&#964;&#949; &#966;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953; &#8001; &#954;&#959;&#963;&#956;&#959;&#960;&#955;&#940;&#957;&#959;&#962; &#8033;&#962; &#965;&#7985;&#8056;&#962; &#952;&#949;&#959;&#8166; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#960;&#959;&#953;&#949;&#8150; &#963;&#951;&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#945; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#964;&#941;&#961;&#945;&#964;&#945;</span>). In the late Christian
Sibylline fragment (iii. 63 &amp;c.) also, &ldquo;Beliar&rdquo; appears above all
as a worker of wonders, this figure having possibly been influenced
by that of Simon Magus. Finally the author of the Apocalypse
of St John also has made use of the new conception of Antichrist
as a wonder-worker and seducer, and has set his figure beside
that of the &ldquo;first&rdquo; Beast which was for him the actual embodiment
of Antichrist (xiii. II &amp;c.). Since this second Beast could
not appear along with the first as a power demanding worship
and directly playing the part of Antichrist, he made out of him
the false prophet (xvi. 13, xix. 20, xx. 10) who seduces the
inhabitants of the earth to worship the first Beast, and probably
interpreted this figure as applying to the Roman provincial
priesthood.<a name="fa6f" id="fa6f" href="#ft6f"><span class="sp">6</span></a></p>

<p>But this version of the idea of Antichrist, hostile to the Jews
and better expressing the relation of Christianity to the Roman
empire, was prevented from obtaining an absolute ascendancy
in Christian tradition by the rise of the belief in the ultimate
return of Nero, and by the absorption of this outcome of pagan
superstition into the Jewish-Christian apocalyptic conceptions.
It is known that soon after the death of Nero rumours were
current that he was not dead. This report soon took the more
concrete form that he had fled to the Parthians and would return
thence to take vengeance on Rome. This expectation led to
the appearance of several pretenders who posed as Nero; and
as late as <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 100 many still held the belief that Nero yet lived.<a name="fa7f" id="fa7f" href="#ft7f"><span class="sp">7</span></a>
This idea of Nero&rsquo;s return was in the first instance taken up by
the Jewish apocalyptic writers. While the Jewish author of the
fourth Sibylline book (<i>c.</i> <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 80) still only refers simply to the
heathen belief, the author of the (Jewish?) original of the 17th
chapter of the Apocalypse of St John expects the return of Nero
with the Parthians to take vengeance on Rome, because she had
shed the blood of the Saints (destruction of Jerusalem!). In
the fifth Sibylline book, which, with the exception of verses 1-51,
was mainly composed by a Jewish writer at the close of the first
century, the return of Nero plays a great part. Three times the
author recurs to this theme, 137-154; 214-227; 361-385. He
sees in the coming again of Nero, whose figure he endows with
supernatural and daemonic characteristics, a judgment of God,
in whose hand the revivified Nero becomes a rod of chastisement.
Later, the figure of Nero <i>redivivus</i> became, more especially in
Christian thought, entirely confused with that of Antichrist.
The less it became possible, as time went on, to believe that Nero
yet lived and would return as a living ruler, the greater was
the tendency for his figure to develop into one wholly infernal
and daemonic. The relation to the Parthians is also gradually
lost sight of; and from being the adversary of Rome, Nero
becomes the adversary of God and of Christ. This is the version
of the expectation of Nero&rsquo;s second coming preserved in the
form given to the prophecy, under Domitian, by the collaborator
in the Apocalypse of John (xiii., xvii.). Nero is here the beast
that returns from the bottomless pit, &ldquo;that was, and is not,
and yet is&rdquo;; the head &ldquo;as it were wounded to death&rdquo; that lives
again; the gruesome similitude of the Lamb that was slain, and
his adversary in the final struggle. The number of the Beast,
666, points certainly to Nero (<span title="keisar neron">&#1503;&#1493;&#1512;&#1504; &#1512;&#1505;&#1511;</span> = 666, or <span title="keisar nero">&#1493;&#1512;&#1504; &#1512;&#1505;&#1511;</span> = 616).
In the little apocalypse of the <i>Ascensio Jesaiae</i> (iii. 13b-iv. 18),
which dates perhaps from the second, perhaps only from the
first, decade of the third century,<a name="fa8f" id="fa8f" href="#ft8f"><span class="sp">8</span></a> it is said that Beliar, the king
of this world, would descend from the firmament in the human
form of Nero. In the same way, in <i>Sibyll.</i> v. 28-34, Nero and
Antichrist are absolutely identical (mostly obscure reminiscences,
<i>Sib.</i> viii. 68 &amp;c., 140 &amp;c., 151 &amp;c.). Then the Nero-legend
gradually fades away. But Victorinus of Pettau,
who wrote during the persecution under Diocletian, still knows
the relation of the Apocalypse to the legend of Nero; and
Commodian, whose <i>Carmen Apologeticum</i> was perhaps not
written until the beginning of the 4th century, knows two Antichrist-figures,
of which he still identifies the first with Nero
<i>redivivus</i>.</p>

<p>In proportion as the figure of Nero again ceased to dominate
the imagination of the faithful, the wholly unhistorical, unpolitical
and anti-Jewish conception of Antichrist, which based
itself more especially on 2 Thess. ii., gained the upper hand,
having usually become associated with the description of the
universal conflagration of the world which had also originated
in the Iranian eschatology. On the strength of exegetical combinations,
and with the assistance of various traditions, it was
developed even in its details, which it thenceforth maintained
practically unchanged. In this form it is in great part present in
the eschatological portions of the <i>Adv. Haereses</i> of Irenaeus, and
in the <i>de Antichristo</i> and commentary on Daniel of Hippolytus.
In times of political excitement, during the following centuries,
men appealed again and again to the prophecy of Antichrist.
Then the foreground scenery of the prophecies was shifted;
special prophecies, having reference to contemporary events,
are pushed to the front, but in the background remains standing,
with scarcely a change, the prophecy of Antichrist that is bound
up with no particular time. Thus at the beginning of the
<i>Testamentum Domini</i>, edited by Rahmani, there is an apocalypse,
possibly of the time of Decius, though it has been worked over
(Harnack, <i>Chronol. der altchrist. Litt.</i> ii. 514 &amp;c.) In the third
century, the period of Aurelianus and Gallienus, with its wild
warfare of Romans and Persians, and of Roman pretenders
one with another, seems especially to have aroused the spirit of
prophecy. To this period belongs the Jewish apocalypse of Elijah
(ed. Buttenwieser), of which the Antichrist is possibly Odaenathus
of Palmyra, while <i>Sibyll.</i> xiii., a Christian writing of this period,
glorifies this very prince. It is possible that at this time also the
Sibylline fragment (iii. 63 &amp;c.) and the Christian recension of the
two first Sibylline books were written.<a name="fa9f" id="fa9f" href="#ft9f"><span class="sp">9</span></a> To this time possibly
belongs also a recension of the Coptic apocalypse of Elijah, edited
by Steindorff (<i>Texte und Untersuchungen</i>, N. F. ii. 3). To the
4th century belongs, according to Kamper (<i>Die deutsche Kaiseridee</i>,
1896, p. 18) and Sackur (<i>Texte und Forschungen</i>, 1898,
p. 114 &amp;c.), the first nucleus of the &ldquo;Tiburtine&rdquo; Sibyl, very celebrated
in the middle ages, with its prophecy of the return of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page123" id="page123"></a>123</span>
Constans, and its dream, which later on exercised so much
influence, that after ruling over the whole world he would go to
Jerusalem and lay down his crown upon Golgotha. To the
4th century also perhaps belongs a series of apocalyptic pieces
and homilies which have been handed down under the name of
Ephraem. At the beginning of the Mahommedan period, then,
we meet with the most influential and the most curious
of these prophetic books, the <i>Pseudo-Methodius</i>,<a name="fa10f" id="fa10f" href="#ft10f"><span class="sp">10</span></a> which
prophesied of the emperor who would awake from his sleep
and conquer Islam. From the <i>Pseudo-Methodius</i> are derived
innumerable Byzantine prophecies (cf. especially Vassiliev,
<i>Anecdota Graeco-Byzantina</i>) which follow the fortunes of
the Byzantine emperors and their governments. A prophecy
in verse, adorned with pictures, which is ascribed to Leo
VI. the Philosopher (Migne, <i>Patr. Gracca</i>, cvii. p. 1121
&amp;c.), tells of the downfall of the house of the Comneni and
sings of the emperor of the future who would one day awake
from death and go forth from the cave in which he had lain.
Thus the prophecy of the sleeping emperor of the future is very
closely connected with the Antichrist tradition. There is extant
a Daniel prophecy which, in the time of the Latin empire, foretells
the restoration of the Greek rule.<a name="fa11f" id="fa11f" href="#ft11f"><span class="sp">11</span></a> In the East, too, Antichrist
prophecies were extraordinarily flourishing during the period of
the rise of Islam and of the Crusades. To these belong the
apocalypses in Arabic, Ethiopian and perhaps also in Syrian,
preserved in the so-called <i>Liber Clementis discipuli S. Petri</i>
(<i>Petri apostoli apocalypsis per Clementem</i>), the late Syrian
apocalypse of Ezra (Bousset, <i>Antichrist</i>, 45 &amp;c.), the Coptic
(14th) vision of Daniel (in the appendix to Woide&rsquo;s edition of the
<i>Codex Alexandrinus</i>; Oxford, 1799), the Ethiopian <i>Wisdom of
the Sibyl</i>, which is closely related to the Tiburtine Sibyl (see
Basset, <i>Apocryphes éthiopiennes</i>, x.); in the last mentioned of
these sources long series of Islamic rulers are foretold before the
final time of Antichrist. Jewish apocalypse also awakes to fresh
developments in the Mahommedan period, and shows a close
relationship with the Christian Antichrist literature. One of the
most interesting apocalypses is the Jewish <i>History of Daniel</i>,
handed down in Persian.<a name="fa12f" id="fa12f" href="#ft12f"><span class="sp">12</span></a></p>

<p>This whole type of prophecy reached the West above all
through the <i>Pseudo-Methodius</i>, which was soon translated into
Latin. Especially influential, too, in this respect was the letter
which the monk Adso in 954 wrote to Queen Gerberga, <i>De ortu
et tempere Antichristi</i>. The old Tiburtine Sibylla went through
edition after edition, in each case being altered so as to apply to
the government of the monarch who happened to be ruling at the
time. Then in the West the period arrived in which eschatology,
and above all the expectation of the coming of Antichrist,
exercised a great influence on the world&rsquo;s history. This period,
as is well known, was inaugurated, at the end of the 12th century,
by the apocalyptic writings of the abbot Joachim of Floris.
Soon the word Antichrist re-echoed from all sides in the
embittered controversies of the West. The pope bestowed this title
upon the emperor, the emperor upon the pope, the Guelphs on
the Ghibellines and the Ghibellines on the Guelphs. In the
contests between the rival powers and courts of the period, the
prophecy of Antichrist played a political part. It gave motives to
art, to lyrical, epic and dramatic poetry.<a name="fa13f" id="fa13f" href="#ft13f"><span class="sp">13</span></a> Among the visionary
Franciscans, enthusiastic adherents of Joachim&rsquo;s prophecies,
arose above all the conviction that the pope was Antichrist, or at
least his precursor. From the Franciscans, influenced by Abbot
Joachim, the lines of connexion are clearly traceable with Milic of
Kremsier (<i>Libellus de Antichristo</i>) and Matthias of Janow. For
Wycliffe and his adherent John Purvey (probably the author of
the <i>Commentarius in Apocalypsin ante centum annos editus</i>,
edited in 1528 by Luther), as on the other hand for Hus, the
conviction that the papacy is essentially Antichrist is absolute.
Finally, if Luther advanced in his contest with the papacy with
greater and greater energy, he did so because he was borne on by
the conviction that the pope in Rome was Antichrist. And if in
the <i>Augustana</i>. the expression of this conviction was suppressed
for political reasons, in the Articles of Schmalkalden, drawn up by
him, Luther propounded it in the most uncompromising fashion.
This sentence was for him an <i>articulus stantis et cadentis ecclesiae</i>.
To write the history of the idea of Antichrist in the last centuries
of the middle ages, would be almost to write that of the middle
ages themselves.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTICYCLONE<a name="ar111" id="ar111"></a></span> (<i>i.e.</i> opposite to a cyclone), an atmospheric
system in which there is a descending movement of the air and a
relative increase in barometric pressure over the part of the
earth&rsquo;s surface affected by it. At the surface the air tends to
flow outwards in all directions from the central area of high
pressure, and is deflected on account of the earth&rsquo;s rotation (see
F<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Errel&rsquo;s Law</a></span>) so as to give a spiral movement in the direction
of the hands of a watch face upwards in the northern
hemisphere, against that direction in the southern hemisphere.
Since the air in an anticyclone is descending, it becomes warmed
and dried, and therefore transmits radiation freely whether from
the sun to the earth or from the earth into space. Hence in
winter anticyclonic weather is characterized by clear air with
periods of frost, causing fogs in towns and low-lying damp areas,

<p><span class="bold">ANTIETAM,<a name="ar113" id="ar113"></a></span> the name of a Maryland creek, near which, on the
16th-17th of September 1862, was fought the battle of Antietam
or Sharpsburg (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">American Civil War</a></span>), between the
Federals under McClellan and the Confederates commanded
by Lee. General McClellan had captured the passes of South
Mountain farther east on the 14th, and his Army of the Potomac
marched to meet Lee&rsquo;s forces which, hitherto divided, had, by
the 16th, successfully concentrated between the Antietam and
the Potomac. The Confederate Army of Northern Virginia
occupied a position which, in relation to the surrounding country,
may be compared to the string of a bow in the act of being
drawn, Lee&rsquo;s left wing forming the upper half of the string, his
right the lower, and the Potomac in his rear the bow itself.
The town of Sharpsburg represents the fingers of the archer
drawing the bow. The right wing of the position was covered
by the Antietam as it approaches the Potomac, the upper course
of that stream formed no part of the battlefield. Generals
Longstreet and Jackson commanded the right and left wings.
The division of A.P. Hill was at Harper&rsquo;s Ferry, but had received
orders to rejoin Lee. McClellan&rsquo;s troops appeared late on the
16th, and Hooker was immediately sent across the upper Antietam.
He had a sharp fight with Jackson&rsquo;s men, but night soon
put an end to the contest. Early on the 19th the corps of Sumner
and Mansfield followed Hooker across the upper stream whilst
McClellan&rsquo;s left wing (Burnside&rsquo;s corps) drew up opposite Lee&rsquo;s
extreme right. The Federal leader intended to hold back his
centre whilst these two forces were rolling up Lee&rsquo;s wings. The
battle began with a furious assault on the extreme right by
Hooker&rsquo;s corps. After a very severe struggle he was repulsed
with the loss of a quarter of his men, Jackson&rsquo;s divisions suffering
even more severely and losing nearly all their generals and
colonels. It was only the arrival of Hood and D.H. Hill which
enabled Stonewall Jackson&rsquo;s corps to hold its ground, and had
the other Federal corps been at hand to support Hooker the
result might have been very different. Mansfield next attacked
farther to the left and with better fortune. Mansfield was killed,
but his successor led the corps well, and after heavy fighting
Hood and D.H. Hill were driven back. Again want of support
checked the Federals and the fight became stationary, both
sides losing many men. Sumner now came into action, and
overhaste involved him in a catastrophe, his troops being attacked
in front and flank and driven back in great confusion with nearly
half their number killed and wounded; and their retreat involved
the gallant remnants of Mansfield&rsquo;s corps. Soon afterwards
the Federal divisions of French and Richardson attacked
D.H. Hill, whose men were now exhausted by continuous
fighting. Here occurred the fighting in the &ldquo;Bloody Lane,&rdquo;
north of Sharpsburg which French and Richardson eventually
carried. Opposed as they were by D.H. Hill, whose men had
fought the battle of South Mountain and had already been
three times engaged <i>à fond</i> on this day, proper support must
have enabled the Federals to crush Lee&rsquo;s centre, but Franklin
and Porter in reserve were not allowed by McClellan to move
forward and the opportunity passed. Burnside, on the southern
wing, had received his orders late, and acted on them still later.
The battle was over on the right before he fired a shot, and Lee
had been able to use nearly all his right wing troops to support
Jackson. At last Burnside moved forward, and, after a brilliant
defence by the handful of men left to oppose him, forced the
Antietam and began to roll up Lee&rsquo;s right, only to be attacked
in rear himself by A.P. Hill&rsquo;s troops newly arrived from Harper&rsquo;s
Ferry. The repulse of Burnside ended the battle. Pressure was
brought to bear on McClellan to renew the fight, but he refused
and Lee retired across the Potomac unmolested. The Army of
the Potomac had lost 11,832 men out of 46,000 engaged; the
cavalry and two corps in reserve had only lost 578. Lee&rsquo;s 31,200
men lost over 8000 of their number.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTI-FEDERALISTS,<a name="ar114" id="ar114"></a></span> the name given in the political history
of the United States to those who, after the formation of the
federal Constitution of 1787, opposed its ratification by the people
of the several states. The &ldquo;party&rdquo; (though it was never
regularly organized as such) was composed of states rights,
particularistic, individualistic and radical democratic elements;
that is, of those persons who thought that a stronger government
threatened the sovereignty and prestige of the states,
or the special interests, individual or commercial, of localities,
or the liberties of individuals, or who fancied they saw in the
government proposed a new centralized, disguised &ldquo;monarchic&rdquo;
power that would only replace the cast-off despotism of Great
Britain. In every state the opposition to the Constitution was
strong, and in two&mdash;North Carolina and Rhode Island&mdash;it
prevented ratification until the definite establishment of the
new government practically forced their adhesion. The individualistic
was the strongest element of opposition; the
necessity, or at least the desirability, of a bill of rights was almost
universally felt. Instead of accepting the Constitution upon the
condition of amendments,&mdash;in which way they might very
likely have secured large concessions,&mdash;the Anti-Federalists
stood for unconditional rejection, and public opinion, which
went against them, proved that for all its shortcomings the
Constitution was regarded as preferable to the Articles of Confederation.
After the inauguration of the new government,
the composition of the Anti-Federalist party changed. The
Federalist (<i>q.v.</i>) party gradually showed broad-construction,
nationalistic tendencies; the Anti-Federalist party became
a strict-construction party and advocated popular rights against
the asserted aristocratic, centralizing tendencies of its opponent,
and gradually was transformed into the Democratic-Republican
party, mustered and led by Thomas Jefferson, who, however,
had approved the ratification of the Constitution and was not,
therefore, an Anti-Federalist in the original sense of that term.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTIGO,<a name="ar115" id="ar115"></a></span> a city and the county-seat of Langlade county,
Wisconsin, U.S.A., about 160 m. N.W. of Milwaukee. Pop.
(1890) 4424; (1900) 5145, of whom 965 were foreign-born;
(1905) 6663; (1910) 7196. It is served by the Chicago &amp; North
Western railway. Antigo is the centre of a good farming and
lumbering district, and its manufactures consist principally of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page125" id="page125"></a>125</span>
lumber, chairs, furniture, sashes, doors and blinds, hubs and spokes,
and other wood products. The city has a Carnegie library.
Antigo was first settled in 1880, and was chartered as a city in
1885. Its name is said to be part of an Indian word, <i>neequee-antigo-sebi</i>,
meaning &ldquo;evergreen.&rdquo;</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANTIGONE,<a name="ar116" id="ar116"></a></span> (1) in Greek legend, daughter of Oedipus and
Iocaste (Jocasta), or, according to the older story, of Euryganeia.
When her father, on discovering that Iocaste, the mother of his
children, was also his own mother, put his eyes out and resigned
the throne of Thebes, she accompanied him into exile at Colonus.
After his death she returned to Thebes, where Haemon, the son
of Creon, king of Thebes, became enamoured of her. When her
brothers Eteocles and Polyneices had slain each other in single
combat, she buried Polyneices, although Creon had forbidden it.
As a punishment she was sentenced to be buried alive in a vault,
where she hanged herself, and Haemon killed himself in despair.
Her character and these incidents of her life presented an attractive
subject to the Greek tragic poets, especially Sophocles in the
<i>Antigone</i> and <i>Oedipus at Colonus</i>, and Euripides, whose <i>Antigone</i>,
though now lost, is partly known from extracts incidentally
preserved in later writers, and from passages in his <i>Phoenissae</i>.
In the order of the events, at least, Sophocles departed from the
original legend, according to which the burial of Polyneices took
place while Oedipus was yet in Thebes, not after he had died at
Colonus. Again, in regard to Antigone&rsquo;s tragic end Sophocles
differs from Euripides, according to whom the calamity was
averted by the intercession of Dionysus and was followed by the
marriage of Antigone and Haemon. In Hyginus&rsquo;s version of the
legend, founded apparently on a tragedy by some follower of
Euripides, Antigone, on being handed over by Creon to her
lover Haemon to be slain, was secretly carried off by him, and
concealed in a shepherd&rsquo;s hut, where she bore him a son Maeon.
When the boy grew up, he went to some funeral games at Thebes,
and was recognized by the mark of a dragon on his body. This
led to the discovery that Antigone was still alive. Heracles
pleaded in vain with Creon for Haemon, who slew both Antigone
and himself, to escape his father&rsquo;s vengeance. On a painted vase
the scene of the intercession of Heracles is represented
(Heydermann, <i>Über eine nacheuripideische Antigone</i>, 1868). Antigone
placing the body of Polyneices on the funeral pile occurs on a
sarcophagus in the villa Pamfili in Rome, and is mentioned in
the description of an ancient painting by Philostratus (<i>Imag.</i> ii.
29), who states that the flames consuming the two brothers burnt
apart, indicating their unalterable hatred, even in death.</p>

<p>(2) A second Antigone was the daughter of Eurytion, king of
Phthia, and wife of Peleus. Her husband, having accidentally
killed Eurytion in the Calydonian boar hunt, fled and obtained
expiation from Acastus, whose wife made advances to Peleus.
Finding that her affection was not returned, she falsely accused
Peleus of infidelity to his wife, who thereupon hanged herself
(Apollodorus, iii. 13).</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTIGONUS CYCLOPS<a name="ar117" id="ar117"></a></span> (or <span class="sc">Monopthalmos</span>; so called from
his having lost an eye) (382-301 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Macedonian king, son of
Philip, was one of the generals of Alexander the Great. He was
made governor of Greater Phrygia in 333, and in the division of
the provinces after Alexander&rsquo;s death (323) Pamphylia and
Lycia were added to his command. He incurred the enmity of
Perdiccas, the regent, by refusing to assist Eumenes (<i>q.v.</i>) to
obtain possession of the provinces allotted to him. In danger
of his life he escaped with his son Demetrius into Greece, where
he obtained the favour of Antipater, regent of Macedonia (321);
and when, soon after, on the death of Perdiccas, a new division
took place, he was entrusted with the command of the war against
Eumenes, who had joined Perdiccas against the coalition of
Antipater, Antigonus, and the other generals. Eumenes was
completely defeated, and obliged to retire to Nora in Cappadocia,
and a new army that was marching to his relief was routed by
Antigonus. Polyperchon succeeding Antipater (d. 319) in the
regency, to the exclusion of Cassander, his son, Antigonus
resolved to set himself up as lord of all Asia, and in conjunction
with Cassander and Ptolemy of Egypt, refused to recognize
Polyperchon. He entered into negotiations with Eumenes; but
Eumenes remained faithful to the royal house. Effecting his
escape from Nora, he raised an army, and formed a coalition
with the satraps of the eastern provinces. He was at last
delivered up to Antigonus through treachery in Persia and put
to death (316). Antigonus again claimed authority over the
whole of Asia, seized the treasures at Susa, and entered Babylonia,
of which Seleucus was governor. Seleucus fled to Ptolemy,
and entered into a league with him (315), together with Lysimachus
and Cassander. After the war had been carried on
with varying success from 315 to 311, peace was concluded, by
which the government of Asia Minor and Syria was provisionally
secured to Antigonus. This agreement was soon violated on the
pretext that garrisons had been placed in some of the free Greek
cities by Antigonus, and Ptolemy and Cassander renewed
hostilities against him. Demetrius Poliorcetes, the son of
Antigonus, wrested part of Greece from Cassander. At first
Ptolemy had made a successful descent upon Asia Minor and on
several of the islands of the Archipelago; but he was at length
totally defeated by Demetrius in a naval engagement off Salamis,
in Cyprus (306). On this victory Antigonus assumed the title
of king, and bestowed the same upon his son, a declaration that
he claimed to be the heir of Alexander. Antigonus now prepared
a large army, and a formidable fleet, the command of which he
gave to Demetrius, and hastened to attack Ptolemy in his own
dominions. His invasion of Egypt, however, proved a failure;
he was unable to penetrate the defences of Ptolemy, and was
obliged to retire. Demetrius now attempted the reduction of
Rhodes, which had refused to assist Antigonus against Egypt;
but, meeting with obstinate resistance, he was obliged to make
a treaty upon the best terms that he could (304). In 302,
although Demetrius was again winning success after success in
Greece, Antigonus was obliged to recall him to meet the confederacy
that had been formed between Cassander, Seleucus
and Lysimachus. A decisive battle was fought at Ipsus, in
which Antigonus fell, in the eighty-first year of his age.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTIGONUS GONATAS<a name="ar118" id="ar118"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 319-239 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Macedonian king,
was the son of Demetrius Poliorcetes, and grandson of Antigonus
Cyclops. On the death of his father (283), he assumed the title
of king of Macedonia, but did not obtain possession of the throne
till 276, after it had been successively in the hands of Pyrrhus,
Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy Ceraunus. Antigonus
repelled the invasion of the Gauls, and continued in undisputed
possession of Macedonia till 274, when Pyrrhus returned from
Italy, and (in 273) made himself master of nearly all the country.
On the advance of Pyrrhus into Peloponnesus, he recovered his
dominions. He was again (between 263 and 255) driven out of
his kingdom by Alexander, the son of Pyrrhus, and again recovered
it. The latter part of his reign was comparatively peaceful, and
he gained the affection of his subjects by his honesty and his
cultivation of the arts. He gathered round him distinguished
literary men&mdash;philosophers, poets, and historians. He died in
the eightieth year of his age, and the forty-fourth of his reign.
His surname was usually derived by later Greek writers from
the name of his supposed birthplace, Gonni (Gonnus) in Thessaly;
some take it to be a Macedonian word signifying an iron plate for
protecting the knee; neither conjecture is a happy one, and in
our ignorance of the Macedonian language it must remain
unexplained.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTIGUA,<a name="ar120" id="ar120"></a></span> an island in the British West Indies, forming,
with Barbuda and Redonda, one of the five presidencies in the
colony of the Leeward Islands. It lies 50 m. E. of St Kitts,
in 17° 6&prime; N. and 61° 45&prime; W., and is 54 m. in circumference, with
an area of 108 sq. m. The surface is comparatively flat, and
there is no central range of mountains as in most other West
Indian islands, but among the hills in the south-west an elevation
of 1328 ft. is attained. Owing to the absence of rivers, the
paucity of springs, and the almost complete deforestation,
Antigua is subject to frequent droughts, and although the average
rainfall is 45.6 in., the variations from year to year are great.
The dryness of the air proves very beneficial to persons suffering
from pulmonary complaints. The high rocky coast is much
indented by bays and arms of the sea, several of which form
excellent harbours, that of St John being safe and commodious,
but inferior to English Harbour, which, although little frequented,
is capable of receiving vessels of the largest size. The soil,
especially in the interior, is very fertile. Sugar and pineapples are
the chief products for export, but sweet potatoes, yams, maize
and guinea corn are grown for local consumption. Antigua is
the residence of the governor of the Leeward Islands, and the
meeting place of the general legislative council, but there is also
a local legislative council of 16 members, half official and half
unofficial. Until 1898, when the Crown Colony system was
adopted, the legislative council was partly elected, partly
nominated. Elementary education is compulsory. Agricultural
training is given under government control, and the Cambridge
local examinations and those of the University of London are
held annually. Antigua is the see of a bishop of the Church
of England, the members of which predominate here, but
Moravians and Wesleyans are numerous. There is a small
volunteer defence force. The island has direct steam communication
with Great Britain, the United States and Canada,
and is also served by the submarine cable. The three chief
towns are St John, Falmouth and Parham. St John (pop.
about 10,000), the capital, situated on the north-west, is an
exceedingly picturesque town, built on an eminence overlooking
one of the most beautiful harbours in the West Indies. Although
both Falmouth and Parham have good harbours, most of the
produce of the island finds its way to St John for shipment.
The trade is chiefly with the United States, and the main exports
are sugar, molasses, logwood, tamarinds, turtles, and pineapples.
The cultivation of cotton has been introduced with success, and
this also is exported. The dependent islands of Barbuda and
Redonda have an area of 62 sq. m. Pop. of Antigua (1901),
34,178; of the presidency, 35,073.</p>

<p>Antigua was discovered in 1493 by Columbus, who is said
to have named it after a church in Seville, called Santa Maria
la Antigua. It remained, however, uninhabited until 1632,
when a body of English settlers took possession of it, and in 1663
another settlement of the same nation was effected under the
direction of Lord Willoughby, to whom the entire island was
granted by Charles II. It was ravaged by the French in 1666,
but was soon after reconquered by the British and formally
restored to them by the treaty of Breda. Since then it has been
a British possession.</p>

an epithet used by the early Christian writers to denote those
books of the New Testament which, although sometimes publicly
read in the churches, were not for a considerable time admitted
to be genuine, or received into the canon of Scripture. They
were thus contrasted with the <i>Homologoumena</i>, or universally
acknowledged writings. Eusebius (<i>Hist. Eccl.</i> iii. 25) applies
the term <i>Antilegomena</i> to the Epistle of James, the Epistle of
Jude, 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, the Acts of Paul, the Shepherd
of Hermas, the Teaching of the Apostles, the Apocalypse of
John, and the Gospel according to the Hebrews. In later usage
it describes those of the New Testament books which have
obtained a doubtful place in the Canon. These are the Epistles
of James and Jude, 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, the Apocalypse of
John, and the Epistle to the Hebrews.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANTILIA<a name="ar122" id="ar122"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Antillia</span>, sometimes called the Island of the
Seven Cities (Portuguese <i>Isla das Sete Cidades</i>), a legendary
island in the Atlantic ocean. The origin of the name is quite
uncertain. The oldest suggested etymology (1455) fancifully
connects it with the name of the Platonic Atlantis, while later
writers have endeavoured to derive it from the Latin <i>anterior</i>
(<i>i.e.</i> the island that is reached &ldquo;before&rdquo; Cipango), or from the
<i>Jezirat al Tennyn</i>, &ldquo;Dragon&rsquo;s Isle,&rdquo; of the Arabian geographers.
Antilia is marked in an anonymous map which is dated 1424 and
preserved in the grand-ducal library at Weimar. It reappears
in the maps of the Genoese B. Beccario or Beccaria (1435),
and of the Venetian Andrea Bianco (1436), and again in 1455
and 1476. In most of these it is accompanied by the smaller
and equally legendary islands of Royllo, St Atanagio, and Tanmar,
the whole group being classified as <i>insulae de novo repertae</i>,
&ldquo;newly discovered islands.&rdquo; The Florentine Paul Toscanelli,
in his letters to Columbus and the Portuguese court (1474),
takes Antilia as the principal landmark for measuring the
distance between Lisbon and the island of Cipango or Zipangu
(Japan). One of the chief early descriptions of Antilia is that
inscribed on the globe which the geographer Martin Behaim made
at Nuremberg in 1492 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Map</a></span>: <i>History</i>). Behaim relates that
in 734&mdash;a date which is probably a misprint for 714&mdash;and after
the Moors had conquered Spain and Portugal, the island of
Antilia or &ldquo;Septe Cidade&rdquo; was colonized by Christian refugees
under the archbishop of Oporto and six bishops. The inscription
adds that a Spanish vessel sighted the island in 1414. According
to an old Portuguese tradition each of the seven leaders founded
and ruled a city, and the whole island became a Utopian commonwealth,
free from the disorders of less favoured states. Later
Portuguese tradition localized Antilia in the island of St Michael&rsquo;s,
the largest of the Azores. It is impossible to estimate how far
this legend commemorates some actual but imperfectly recorded
discovery, and how far it is a reminiscence of the ancient idea
of an elysium in the western seas which is embodied in the
legends of the Isles of the Blest or Fortunate Islands.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANTILLES,<a name="ar123" id="ar123"></a></span> a term of somewhat doubtful origin, now generally
used, especially by foreign writers, as synonymous with the
expression &ldquo;West India Islands.&rdquo; Like &ldquo;Brazil,&rdquo; it dates
from a period anterior to the discovery of the New World,
&ldquo;Antilia,&rdquo; as stated above, being one of those mysterious
lands, which figured on the medieval charts sometimes as an
archipelago, sometimes as continuous land of greater or lesser
extent, constantly fluctuating in mid-ocean between the Canaries
and East India. But it came at last to be identified with the
land discovered by Columbus. Later, when this was found to
consist of a vast archipelago enclosing the Caribbean Sea and
Gulf of Mexico, <i>Antilia</i> assumed its present plural form, <i>Antilles</i>,
which was collectively applied to the whole of this archipelago.</p>

<p>A distinction is made between the Greater Antilles, including
Cuba, Jamaica, Haiti, and Porto Riro; and the Lesser Antilles,
covering the remainder of the islands.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTILOCHUS,<a name="ar124" id="ar124"></a></span> in Greek legend, son of Nestor, king of Pylos.
One of the suitors of Helen, he accompanied his father to the
Trojan War. He was distinguished for his beauty, swiftness of
foot, and skill as a charioteer; though the youngest among the
Greek princes, he commanded the Pylians in the war, and
performed many deeds of valour. He was a favourite of the
gods, and an intimate friend of Achilles, to whom he was commissioned
to announce the death of Patroclus. When his father
was attacked by Memnon, he saved his life at the sacrifice of his
own (Pindar, <i>Pyth.</i> vi. 28), thus fulfilling an oracle which had
bidden him &ldquo;beware of an Ethiopian.&rdquo; His death was avenged
by Achilles. According to other accounts, he was slain by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page127" id="page127"></a>127</span>
Hector (Hyginus, <i>Fab.</i> 113), or by Paris in the temple of the
Thymbraean Apollo together with Achilles (Dares Phrygius 34).
His ashes, with those of Achilles and Patroclus, were deposited
in a mound on the promontory of Sigeum, where the inhabitants
of Ilium offered sacrifice to the dead heroes (<i>Odyssey</i>, xxiv. 72;
Strabo xiii. p. 596). In the <i>Odyssey</i> (xi. 468) the three friends
are represented as united in the underworld and walking together
in the fields of asphodel; according to Pausanias (iii. 19) they
dwell together in the island of Leuke.</p>

fabric. The name is attributable to the unguent for the
hair commonly used in the early 19th century,&mdash;Byron calls it
&ldquo;thine incomparable oil, Macassar.&rdquo; The original antimacassar
was almost invariably made of white crochet-work, very stiff,
hard, and uncomfortable, but in the third quarter of the 19th
century it became simpler and less inartistic, and was made of
soft coloured stuffs, usually worked with a simple pattern in

<p><span class="bold">ANTIMACHUS,<a name="ar126" id="ar126"></a></span> of Colophon or Claros, Greek poet and grammarian,
flourished about 400 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Scarcely anything is known
of his life. His poetical efforts were not generally appreciated,
although he received encouragement from his younger contemporary
Plato (Plutarch, <i>Lysander</i>, 18). His chief works
were: a long-winded epic <i>Thebais</i>, an account of the expedition
of the Seven against Thebes and the war of the Epigoni; and
an elegiac poem <i>Lyde</i>, so called from the poet&rsquo;s mistress, for
whose death he endeavoured to find consolation by ransacking
mythology for stories of unhappy love affairs (Plutarch, <i>Consol. ad
Apoll.</i> 9; Athenaeus xiii. 597). Antimachus was the founder
of &ldquo;learned&rdquo; epic poetry, and the forerunner of the Alexandrian
school, whose critics allotted him the next place to Homer. He
also prepared a critical recension of the Homeric poems.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTI-MASONIC PARTY,<a name="ar127" id="ar127"></a></span> an American political organization
which had its rise after the mysterious disappearance, in 1826,
of William Morgan (<i>c.</i> 1776-<i>c.</i> 1826), a Freemason of Batavia,
New York, who had become dissatisfied with his Order and had
planned to publish its secrets. When his purpose became known
to the Masons, Morgan was subjected to frequent annoyances,
and finally in September 1826 he was seized and surreptitiously
conveyed to Fort Niagara, whence he disappeared. Though his
ultimate fate was never known, it was generally believed at the
time that he had been foully dealt with. The event created
great excitement, and led many to believe that Masonry and
good citizenship were incompatible. Opposition to Masonry
was taken up by the churches as a sort of religious crusade, and
it also became a local political issue in western New York, where
early in 1827 the citizens in many mass meetings resolved to
support no Mason for public office. In New York at this time
the National Republicans, or &ldquo;Adams men,&rdquo; were a very feeble
organization, and shrewd political leaders at once determined
to utilize the strong anti-Masonic feeling in creating a new and
vigorous party to oppose the rising Jacksonian Democracy. In
this effort they were aided by the fact that Jackson was a high
Mason and frequently spoke in praise of the Order. In the
elections of 1828 the new party proved unexpectedly strong, and
after this year it practically superseded the National Republican
party in New York. In 1829 the hand of its leaders was shown,
when, in addition to its antagonism to the Masons, it became
a champion of internal improvements and of the protective tariff.
From New York the movement spread into other middle states
and into New England, and became especially strong in Pennsylvania
and Vermont. A national organization was planned as
early as 1827, when the New York leaders attempted, unsuccessfully,
to persuade Henry Clay, though a Mason, to renounce the
Order and head the movement. In September 1831 the party
at a national convention in Baltimore nominated as its candidates
for the presidency and vice-presidency William Wirt of Maryland
and Amos Ellmaker (1787-1851) of Pennsylvania; and in the
election of the following year it secured the seven electoral votes
of the state of Vermont. This was the high tide of its prosperity;
in New York in 1833 the organization was moribund, and its
members gradually united with other opponents of Jacksonian
Democracy in forming the Whig party. In other states, however,
the party survived somewhat longer, but by 1836 most of its
members had united with the Whigs. Its last act in national
politics was to nominate William Henry Harrison for president
and John Tyler for vice-president at a convention in Philadelphia
in November 1838.</p>

<p>The growth of the anti-Masonic movement was due to the
political and social conditions of the time rather than to the
Morgan episode, which was merely the torch that ignited the
train. Under the name of &ldquo;Anti-Masons&rdquo; able leaders united
those who were discontented with existing political conditions,
and the fact that William Wirt, their choice for the presidency
in 1832, was not only a Mason but even defended the Order in a
speech before the convention that nominated him, indicates
that simple opposition to Masonry soon became a minor factor
in holding together the various elements of which the party was
composed.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTIMONY<a name="ar128" id="ar128"></a></span> (symbol Sb, atomic weight 120.2), one of the
metallic chemical elements, included in the same natural family
of the elements as nitrogen, phosphorus, arsenic, and bismuth.
Antimony, in the form of its sulphide, has been known from very
early times, more especially in Eastern countries, reference to
it being made in the Old Testament. The Arabic name for the
naturally occurring stibnite is &ldquo;kohl&rdquo;; Dioscorides mentions it
under the term <span class="grk" title="stimmi">&#963;&#964;&#943;&#956;&#956;&#953;</span>, Pliny as <i>stibium</i>; and Geber as <i>antimonium</i>.
By the German writers it is called <i>Speissglanz</i>. Basil Valentine
alludes to it in his <i>Triumphal Car of Antimony</i> (circa 1600), and
at a later date describes the preparation of the metal.</p>

<p>Native mineral antimony is occasionally found, and as such
was first recognized in 1748. It usually occurs as lamellar or
glanular masses, with a tin-white colour and metallic lustre, in
limestone or in mineral veins often in association with ores of
silver. Distinct crystals are rarely met with; these are rhombohedral
and isomorphous with arsenic and bismuth; they have
a perfect cleavage parallel to the basal plane, <i>c</i> (111), and are
sometimes twinned on a rhombohedral plane, <i>e</i> (110). Hardness
3-3½ specific gravity 6.63-6.72. Sala in Sweden, Allemont in
Dauphine, and Sarawak in Borneo may be mentioned as some of
the localities for this mineral.</p>

<p>Antimony, however, occurs chiefly as the sulphide, stibnite;
to a much smaller extent it occurs in combination with other
metallic sulphides in the minerals wolfsbergite, boulangerite,
bournonite, pyrargyrite, &amp;c. For the preparation of metallic
antimony the crude stibnite is first liquated, to free it from
earthy and siliceous matter, and is then roasted in order to
convert it into oxide. After oxidation, the product is reduced by
heating with carbon, care being taken to prevent any loss through
volatilization, by covering the mass with a layer of some protective
substance such as potash, soda or glauber salt, which also aids
the refining. For rich ores the method of roasting the sulphide
with metallic iron is sometimes employed; carbon and salt or
sodium sulphate being used to slag the iron. Electrolytic
methods, in which a solution of antimony sulphide in sodium
sulphide is used as the electrolyte, have been proposed (see
German Patent 67973, and also Borcher&rsquo;s <i>Electro-Metallurgie</i>),
but do not yet appear to have been used on the large scale.</p>

<p>Antimony combines readily with many other metals to form
alloys, some of which find extensive application in the arts.
Type-metal is an alloy of lead with antimony and tin, to which
occasionally a small quantity of copper or zinc is added. The
presence of the antimony in this alloy gives to it hardness, and
the property of expanding on solidification, thus allowing a sharp
cast of the letter to be taken. An alloy of tin and antimony forms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page128" id="page128"></a>128</span>
the basis of Britannia-metal, small quantities of copper, lead,
zinc or bismuth being added. It is a white metal of bluish
tint and is malleable and ductile. For the linings of brasses,
various white metals are used, these being alloys of copper,
antimony and tin, and occasionally lead.</p>

<p>Antimony is a silvery white, crystalline, brittle metal, and has
a high lustre. Its specific gravity varies from 6.7 to 6.86; it
melts at 432° C. (Dalton), and boils between 1090-1600° C.
(T. Carnelley), or above 1300° (V. Meyer). Its specific heat is
0.0523 (H. Kopp). The vapour density of antimony at 1572° C.
is 10.74, and at 1640° C. 9.78 (V. Meyer, <i>Berichte</i>, 1889, 22, p. 725),
so that the antimony molecule is less complex than the molecules
of the elements phosphorus and arsenic. An amorphous modification
of antimony can be prepared by heating the metal in a
stream of nitrogen, when it condenses in the cool part of the
apparatus as a grey powder of specific gravity 6.22, melting at
614° C. and containing 98-99% of antimony (F. Herard, <i>Comptes
Rendus</i>, 1888, cvii. 420).</p>

<p>Another form of the metal, known as explosive antimony, was
discovered by G. Gore (<i>Phil. Trans.</i>, 1858, p. 185; 1859, p. 797;
1862, p. 623), on electrolysing a solution of antimony trichloride
in hydrochloric acid, using a positive pole of antimony and a
negative pole of copper or platinum wire. It has a specific
gravity of 5.78 and always contains some unaltered antimony
trichloride (from 6 to 20%, G. Gore). It is very unstable, a
scratch causing it instantaneously to pass into the stable form
with explosive violence and the development of much heat.
Similar phenomena are exhibited in the electrolysis of solutions
of antimony tribromide and tri-iodide, the product obtained
from the tribromide having a specific gravity of 5.4, and containing
18-20% of antimony tribromide, whilst that from the
tri-iodide has a specific gravity of 5.2-5.8 and contains about 22%
of hydriodic acid and antimony tri-iodide.</p>

<p>The atomic weight of antimony has been determined by
the analysis of the chloride, bromide and iodide. J.P. Cooke
(<i>Proc. Amer. Acad.</i>, 1878, xiii. i) and J. Bongartz (<i>Berichte</i>, 1883,
16, p. 1942) obtained the value 120, whilst F. Pfeiffer (<i>Ann. Chim.
et Phys.</i> ccix. 173) obtained the value 121 from the electrolysis
of the chloride.</p>

<p>Pure antimony is quite permanent in air at ordinary temperatures,
but when heated in air or oxygen it burns, forming the
trioxide. It decomposes steam at a red heat, and burns
(especially when finely powdered) in chlorine. Dilute hydrochloric
acid is without action on it, but on warming with the concentrated
acid, antimony trichloride is formed; it dissolves in warm
concentrated sulphuric acid, the sulphate Sb<span class="su">2</span>(SO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">3</span> being formed.
Nitric acid oxidizes antimony either to the trioxide Sb<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">6</span> or
the pentoxide Sb<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">5</span>, the product obtained depending on the
temperature and concentration of the acid. It combines directly
with sulphur and phosphorus, and is readily oxidized when heated
with metallic oxides (such as litharge, mercuric oxide, manganese
dioxide, &amp;c.). Antimony and its salts may be readily detected
by the orange precipitate of antimony sulphide which is produced
when sulphuretted hydrogen is passed through their acid solutions,
and also by the Marsh test (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Arsenic</a></span>); in this latter case
the black stain produced is not soluble in bleaching powder
solution. Antimony compounds when heated on charcoal with
sodium carbonate in the reducing flame give brittle beads of
metallic antimony, and a white incrustation of the oxide. The
antimonious compounds are decomposed on addition of water,
with formation of basic salts.</p>

<p>Antimony may be estimated quantitatively by conversion into
the sulphide; the precipitate obtained is dried at 100° C. and
heated in a current of carbon dioxide, or it may be converted
into the tetroxide by nitric acid.</p>

<p>Antimony, like phosphorus and arsenic, combines directly
with hydrogen. The compound formed, antimoniuretted
hydrogen or stibine, SbH<span class="su">3</span>, may also be prepared by the action
of hydrochloric acid on an alloy of antimony and zinc, or by the
action of nascent hydrogen on antimony compounds. As prepared
by these methods it contains a relatively large amount of
hydrogen, from which it can be freed by passing through a tube
immersed in liquid air, when it condenses to a white solid. It is
a poisonous colourless gas, with a characteristic offensive smell.
In its general behaviour it resembles arsine, burning with a violet
flame and being decomposed by heat into its constituent elements.
When passed into silver nitrate solution it gives a black precipitate
of silver antimonide, SbAg<span class="su">3</span>. It is decomposed by the halogen
elements and also by sulphuretted hydrogen. All three hydrogen
atoms are replaceable by organic radicals and the resulting
compounds combine with compounds of the type RCl, RBr and
RI to form stibonium compounds.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>There are three known oxides of antimony, the trioxide Sb<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">6</span>
which is capable of combining with both acids and bases to form
salts, the tetroxide Sb<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">4</span> and the pentoxide Sb<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">5</span>. Antimony trioxide
occurs as the minerals valentinite and senarmontite, and can
be artificially prepared by burning antimony in air; by heating the
metal in steam to a bright red heat; by oxidizing melted antimony
with litharge; by decomposing antimony trichloride with an aqueous
solution of sodium carbonate, or by the action of dilute nitric acid
on the metal. It is a white powder, almost insoluble in water, and
when volatilized, condenses in two crystalline forms, either octahedral
or prismatic. It is insoluble in sulphuric and nitric acids, but
is readily soluble in hydrochloric and tartaric acids and in solutions
of the caustic alkalies. On strongly heating in air it is converted
into the tetroxide. The corresponding hydroxide, orthoantimonious
acid, Sb(OH)<span class="su">3</span>, can be obtained in a somewhat impure form by precipitating
tartar emetic with dilute sulphuric acid; or better by decomposing
antimonyl tartaric acid with sulphuric acid and drying the
precipitated white powder at 100° C. Antimony tetroxide is formed
by strongly heating either the trioxide or pentoxide. It is a nonvolatile
white powder, and has a specific gravity of 6.6952; it is
insoluble in water and almost so in acids&mdash;concentrated hydrochloric
acid dissolving a small quantity. It is decomposed by a hot solution
of potassium bitartrate. Antimony pentoxide is obtained by
repeatedly evaporating antimony with nitric acid and heating the
resulting antimonic acid to a temperature not above 275° C.; by
heating antimony with red mercuric oxide until the mass becomes
yellow (J. Berzelius); or by evaporating antimony trichloride to
dryness with nitric acid. It is a pale yellow powder (of specific
gravity 6.5), which on being heated strongly gives up oxygen and
forms the tetroxide. It is insoluble in water, but dissolves slowly in
hydrochloric acid. It possesses a feeble acid character, giving
metantimoniates when heated with alkaline carbonates.</p>

<p>Orthoantimonic acid, H<span class="su">3</span>SbO<span class="su">4</span>, is obtained by the decomposition
of its potassium salt with nitric acid (A. Geuther); or by the addition
of water to the pentachloride, the precipitate formed being dried
over sulphuric acid (P. Conrad, <i>Chem. News</i>, 1879, xl. 198). It is a
white powder almost insoluble in water and nitric acid, and when
heated, is first converted into metantimonic acid, HSbO<span class="su">3</span>, and then
into the pentoxide Sb<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">5</span>. Pyroantimonic acid, H<span class="su">4</span>Sb<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">7</span> (the
metantimonic acid of E. Frémy), is obtained by decomposing
antimony pentachloride with hot water, and drying the precipitate
so obtained at 100° C. It is a white powder which is more soluble
in water and acids than orthoantimonic acid. It forms two
series of salts, of the types M<span class="su">2</span>H<span class="su">2</span>Sb<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">7</span> and M<span class="su">4</span>Sb<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">7</span>. Metantimonic
acid, HSbO<span class="su">3</span>, can be obtained by heating orthoantimonic acid to
175° C., or by long fusion of antimony with antimony sulphide and
nitre. The fused mass is extracted with water, nitric acid is added
to the solution, and the precipitate obtained washed with water
(J. Berzelius). It is a white powder almost insoluble in water. On
standing with water for some time it is slowly converted into the
ortho-acid.</p>

<p>Compounds of antimony with all the halogen elements are known,
one atom of the metal combining with three or five atoms of the
halogen, except in the case of bromine, where only the tribromide is
known. The majority of these halide compounds are decomposed
by water, with the formation of basic salts. Antimony trichloride
(&ldquo;Butter of Antimony&rdquo;), SbCl<span class="su">3</span>, is obtained by burning the metal in
chlorine; by distilling antimony with excess of mercuric chloride;
and by fractional distillation of antimony tetroxide or trisulphide in
hydrochloric acid solution. It is a colourless deliquescent solid of
specific gravity 3.06; it melts at 73.2° C. (H. Kopp) to a colourless
oil; and boils at 223° (H. Capitaine). It is soluble in alcohol and in
carbon bisulphide, and also in a small quantity of water; but with
an excess of water it gives a precipitate of various oxychlorides,
known as powder of algaroth (<i>q.v.</i>). These precipitated oxychlorides
on continued boiling with water lose all their chlorine and ultimately
give a residue of antimony trioxide. It combines with chlorides of
the alkali metals to form double salts, and also with barium, calcium,
strontium, and magnesium chlorides. Antimony pentachloride,
SbCl<span class="su">5</span> is prepared by heating the trichloride in a current of chlorine.
It is a nearly colourless fuming liquid of unpleasant smell, which can
be solidified to a mass of crystals melting at -6°C. It dissociates into
the trichloride and chlorine when heated. It combines with water,
forming the hydrates SbCl<span class="su">5</span>·H<span class="su">2</span>O and SbCl<span class="su">5</span>·4H<span class="su">2</span>O; it also combines
with phosphorus oxychloride, hydrocyanic acid, and cyanogen
chloride. In chloroform solution it combines with anhydrous oxalic
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page129" id="page129"></a>129</span>
acid to form a compound, Sb<span class="su">2</span>Cl<span class="su">8</span>(C<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">4</span>), which is to be considered as
tetra-chlorstibonium oxalate
<img style="width:83px; height:49px" src="images/img129.jpg" alt="" />
(R. Anschütz and Evans,
<i>Annalen</i>, 1887, ccxxxix. 235). Antimonyl chloride, SbOCl, is produced
by the decomposition of one part of the trichloride with four
parts of water. Prepared in this way it contains a small quantity
of the unaltered chloride, which can be removed by ether or carbon
bisulphide. It is a white powder insoluble in water, alcohol and
ether. On heating, it is converted into the oxychloride Sb<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">5</span>Cl<span class="su">2</span>
(Sb<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">3</span>·SbOCl). Antimony oxychloride, SbOCl<span class="su">3</span>, is formed by addition
of the calculated quantity of water to ice-cooled antimony
pentachloride, SbCl<span class="su">5</span> + H<span class="su">2</span>O = SbOCl<span class="su">3</span> + 2HCl. It forms a yellowish
crystalline precipitate which in moist air goes to a thick liquid.
Compounds of composition, SbOCl<span class="su">3</span>·2SbCl<span class="su">5</span> and SbO<span class="su">2</span>Cl·2SbOCl<span class="su">3</span>,
have also been described (W.C. Williams, <i>Chem. News</i>. 1871, xxiv.
234).</p>

<p>Antimony tribromide, SbBr<span class="su">3</span>, and tri-iodide, SbI<span class="su">3</span>, may be prepared
by the action of antimony on solutions of bromine or iodine in
carbon bisulphide. The tribromide is a colourless crystalline mass
of specific gravity 4.148 (23°), melting at 90° to 94° C. and boiling at
275.4° C. (H. Kopp). The tri-iodide forms red-coloured crystals of
specific gravity 4.848 (26°), melting at 165° to 167° C. and boiling at
401° C. By the action of water they give oxybromides and oxyiodides
SbOBr, Sb<span class="su">4</span>O<span class="su">5</span>Br<span class="su">2</span>, SbOI. Antimony penta-iodide, SbI<span class="su">5</span>, is
formed by heating antimony with excess of iodine, in a sealed tube,
to a temperature not above 130°C. It forms a dark brown crystalline
mass, melting at 78° to 79° C., and is easily dissociated on heating.
Antimony trifluoride, SbF<span class="su">3</span>, is obtained by dissolving the trioxide in
aqueous hydrofluoric acid or by distilling antimony with mercuric
fluoride. By rapid evaporation of its solution it may be obtained
in small prisms. The pentafluoride SbF<span class="su">5</span> results when metantimonic
acid is dissolved in hydrofluoric acid, and the solution is evaporated.
It forms an amorphous gummy mass, which is decomposed by heat.
Oxyfluorides of composition SbOF and SbOF<span class="su">3</span> are known.</p>

<p>Two sulphides of antimony are definitely known, the trisulphide
Sb<span class="su">2</span>S<span class="su">3</span> and the pentasulphide Sb<span class="su">2</span>S<span class="su">5</span>; a third, the tetrasulphide Sb<span class="su">2</span>S<span class="su">4</span>,
has also been described, but its existence is doubtful. Antimony
trisulphide, Sb<span class="su">2</span>S<span class="su">3</span>, occurs as the mineral antimonite or stibnite, from
which the commercial product is obtained by a process of liquation.
The amorphous variety may be obtained from the crystalline form
by dissolving it in caustic potash or soda or in solutions of alkaline
sulphides, and precipitating the hot solution by dilute sulphuric acid.
The precipitate is then washed with water and dried at 100° C.,
by which treatment it is obtained in the anhydrous form. On
precipitating antimony trichloride or tartar emetic in acid solution
with sulphuretted hydrogen, an orange-red precipitate of the hydrated
sulphide is obtained, which turns black on being heated to
200° C The trisulphide heated in a current of hydrogen is reduced
to the metallic state; it burns in air forming the tetroxide, and is
soluble in concentrated hydrochloric acid, in solutions of the caustic
alkalis, and in alkaline sulphides. By the union of antimony trisulphide
with basic sulphides, livers of antimony are obtained.
These substances are usually prepared by fusing their components
together, and are dark powders which are less soluble in water the
more antimony they contain. These thioantimonites are used in
the vulcanizing of rubber and in the preparation of matches. Antimony
pentasulphide, Sb<span class="su">2</span>S<span class="su">5</span>, is prepared by precipitating a solution
of the pentachloride with sulphuretted hydrogen, by decomposing
&ldquo;Schlippe&rsquo;s salt&rdquo; (<i>q.v.</i>) with an acid, or by passing sulphuretted
hydrogen into water containing antimonic acid. It forms a fine
dark orange powder, insoluble in water, but readily soluble in aqueous
solutions of the caustic alkalis and alkaline carbonates. On
heating in absence of air, it decomposes into the trisulphide and
sulphur.</p>

<p>An antimony phosphide and arsenide are known, as is also a
thiophosphate, SbPS<span class="su">4</span>, which is prepared by heating together antimony
trichloride and phosphorus pentasulphide.</p>

<p>Many organic compounds containing antimony are known. By
distilling an alloy of antimony and sodium with mythyl iodide,
mixed with sand, trimethyl stibine, Sb(CH<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">3</span>, is obtained; this combines
with excess of methyl iodide to form tetramethyl stibonium
iodide, Sb(CH<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">4</span>I. From this iodide the trimethyl stibine may be
obtained by distillation with an alloy of potassium and antimony
in a current of carbon dioxide. It is a colourless liquid, slightly
soluble in water, and is spontaneously inflammable. The stibonium
iodide on treatment with moist silver oxide gives the corresponding
tetramethyl stibonium hydroxide, Sb(CH<span class="su">3</span>)<span class="su">4</span>OH, which forms
deliquescent crystals, of alkaline reaction, and absorbs carbon
dioxide readily. On distilling trimethyl stibine with zinc methyl,
antimony tetra-methyl and penta-methyl are formed. Corresponding
antimony compounds containing the ethyl group are known, as
is also a tri-phenyl stibine, Sb(C<span class="su">6</span>H<span class="su">5</span>)<span class="su">3</span>, which is prepared from antimony
trichloride, sodium and monochlorbenzene. See Chung Yu
Wang, <i>Antimony</i> (1909).</p>

<p><i>Antimony in Medicine.</i>&mdash;So far back as Basil Valentine and
Paracelsus, antimonial preparations were in great vogue as
medicinal agents, and came to be so much abused that a
prohibition was placed upon their employment by the Paris parlement
in 1566. Metallic antimony was utilized to make goblets
in which wine was allowed to stand so as to acquire emetic
properties, and &ldquo;everlasting&rdquo; pills of the metal, supposed to
act by contact merely, were administered and recovered for
future use after they had fulfilled their purpose. Antimony
compounds act as irritants both externally and internally.
Tartar emetic (antimony tartrate) when swallowed, acts directly
on the wall of the stomach, producing vomiting, and after
absorption continues this effect by its action on the medulla.
It is a powerful cardiac depressant, diminishing both the force
and frequency of the heart&rsquo;s beat. It depresses respiration, and
in large doses lowers temperature. It depresses the nervous
system, especially the spinal cord. It is excreted by all the
secretions and excretions of the body. Thus as it passes out by
the bronchial mucous membrane it increases the amount of
secretion and so acts as an expectorant. On the skin its action
is that of a diaphoretic, and being also excreted by the bile it
acts slightly as a cholagogue. Summed up, its action is that
of an irritant, and a cardiac and nervous depressant. But on
account of this depressant action it is to be avoided for women
and children and rarely used for men.</p>

<p><i>Toxicology.</i>&mdash;Antimony is one of the &ldquo;protoplasmic&rdquo; poisons,
directly lethal to all living matter. In acute poisoning by it the
symptoms are almost identical with those of arsenical poisoning,
which is much commoner (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Arsenic</a></span>). The post-mortem
appearances are also very similar, but the gastro-intestinal
irritation is much less marked and inflammation of the lungs is
more commonly seen. If the patient is not already vomiting
freely the treatment is to use the stomach-pump, or give sulphate
of zinc (gr. 10-30) by the mouth or apomorphine (gr. <span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">20</span>-<span class="spp">1</span>&frasl;<span class="suu">10</span>)
subcutaneously. Frequent doses of a teaspoonful of tannin
dissolved in water should be administered, together with strong
tea and coffee and mucilaginous fluids. Stimulants may be given
subcutaneously, and the patient should be placed in bed between
warm blankets with hot-water bottles. Chronic poisoning by
antimony is very rare, but resembles in essentials chronic
poisoning by arsenic. In its medico-legal aspects antimonial

<p><span class="bold">ANTINOMIANS<a name="ar129" id="ar129"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="anti">&#7936;&#957;&#964;&#943;</span>, against, <span class="grk" title="nomos">&#957;&#972;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span>, law), a term
apparently coined by Luther to stigmatize Johannes Agricola
(<i>q.v.</i>) and his following, indicating an interpretation of the antithesis
between law and gospel, recurrent from the earliest times.
Christians being released, in important particulars, from conformity
to the Old Testament polity as a whole, a real difficulty
attended the settlement of the limits and the immediate authority
of the remainder, known vaguely as the moral law. Indications
are not wanting that St Paul&rsquo;s doctrine of justification by faith
was, in his own day, mistaken or perverted in the interests of
immoral licence. Gnostic sects approached the question in two
ways. Marcionites, named by Clement of Alexandria <i>Antitactae</i>
(revolters against the Demiurge) held the Old Testament economy
to be throughout tainted by its source; but they are not accused
of licentiousness. Manichaeans, again, holding their spiritual
being to be unaffected by the action of matter, regarded carnal
sins as being, at worst, forms of bodily disease. Kindred to this
latter view was the position of sundry sects of English fanatics
during the Commonwealth, who denied that an elect person
sinned, even when committing acts in themselves gross and evil.
Different from either of these was the Antinomianism charged
by Luther against Agricola. Its starting-point was a dispute
with Melanchthon in 1527 as to the relation between repentance
and faith. Melanchthon urged that repentance must precede
faith, and that knowledge of the moral law is needed to produce
repentance. Agricola gave the initial place to faith, maintaining
that repentance is the work, not of law, but of the gospel-given
knowledge of the love of God. The resulting Antinomian
controversy (the only one within the Lutheran body in Luther&rsquo;s
lifetime) is not remarkable for the precision or the moderation
of the combatants on either side. Agricola was apparently
satisfied in conference with Luther and Melanchthon at Torgau,
December 1527. His eighteen <i>Positiones</i> of 1537 revived the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page130" id="page130"></a>130</span>
controversy and made it acute. Random as are some of his
statements, he was consistent in two objects: (1) in the interest
of solifidian doctrine, to place the rejection of the Catholic
doctrine of good works on a sure ground; (2) in the interest of the
New Testament, to find all needful guidance for Christian duty
in its principles, if not in its precepts. From the latter part of
the 17th century charges of Antinomianism have frequently
been directed against Calvinists, on the ground of their disparagement
of &ldquo;deadly doing&rdquo; and of &ldquo;legal preaching.&rdquo;
The virulent controversy between Arminian and Calvinistic
Methodists produced as its ablest outcome Fletcher&rsquo;s <i>Checks to
Antinomianism</i> (1771-1775).</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTINOMY<a name="ar130" id="ar130"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="anti">&#7936;&#957;&#964;&#943;</span>, against, <span class="grk" title="nomos">&#957;&#972;&#956;&#959;&#962;</span>, law), literally, the
mutual incompatibility, real or apparent, of two laws. The
term acquired a special significance in the philosophy of Kant,
who used it to describe the contradictory results of applying to
the universe of pure thought the categories or criteria proper to
the universe of sensible perception (phenomena). These antinomies
are four&mdash;two mathematical, two dynamical&mdash;connected
with (1) the limitation of the universe in respect of space and
time, (2) the theory that the whole consists of indivisible atoms
(whereas, in fact, none such exist), (3) the problem of freedom in
relation to universal causality, (4) the existence of a universal
being&mdash;about each of which pure reason contradicts the empirical,
as thesis and antithesis. Kant claimed to solve these
contradictions by saying, that in no case is the contradiction
real, however really it has been intended by the opposing partisans,
or must appear to the mind without critical enlightenment.
It is wrong, therefore, to impute to Kant, as is often done, the
view that human reason is, on ultimate subjects, at war with
itself, in the sense of being impelled by equally strong arguments
towards alternatives contradictory of each other. The difficulty
arises from a confusion between the spheres of phenomena and
noumena. In fact no rational cosmology is possible.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTINOÜS,<a name="ar131" id="ar131"></a></span> a beautiful youth of Claudiopolis in Bithynia,
was the favourite of the emperor Hadrian, whom he accompanied
on his journeys. He committed suicide by drowning himself
in the Nile (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 130), either in a fit of melancholy or in order
to prolong his patron&rsquo;s life by his voluntary sacrifice. After
his death, Hadrian caused the most extravagant respect to be
paid to his memory. Not only were cities called after him,
medals struck with his effigy, and statues erected to him in all
parts of the empire, but he was raised to the rank of the gods,
temples were built for his worship in Bithynia, Mantineia in
Arcadia, and Athens, festivals celebrated in his honour and
oracles delivered in his name. The city of Antinoöpolis was
founded on the ruins of Besa where he died (Dio Cassius lix. 11;
Spartianus, <i>Hadrian</i>). A number of statues, busts, gems and
coins represented Antinoüs as the ideal type of youthful
beauty, often with the attributes of some special god. We still
possess a colossal bust in the Vatican, a bust in the Louvre, a
bas-relief from the Villa Albani, a statue in the Capitoline
museum, another in Berlin, another in the Lateran, and many

<p><span class="bold">ANTIOCH.<a name="ar132" id="ar132"></a></span> There were sixteen cities known to have been
founded under this name by Hellenistic monarchs; and at least
twelve others were renamed Antioch. But by far the most famous
and important in the list was <span class="grk" title="Antiocheia ê epi Daphnae">&#902;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#972;&#967;&#949;&#953;&#945; &#7969; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#916;&#940;&#966;&#957;&#8131;</span> (mod.
<i>Antakia</i>), situated on the left bank of the Orontes, about 20 m.
from the sea and its port, Seleucia of Pieria (<i>Suedia</i>). Founded
as a Greek city in 300 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> by Seleucus Nicator, as soon as he
had assured his grip upon western Asia by the victory of Ipsus
(301), it was destined to rival Alexandria in Egypt as the chief
city of the nearer East, and to be the cradle of gentile Christianity.
The geographical character of the district north and north-east of
the elbow of Orontes makes it the natural centre of Syria, so long
as that country is held by a western power; and only Asiatic,
and especially Arab, dynasties have neglected it for the oasis of
Damascus. The two easiest routes from the Mediterranean,
lying through the Orontes gorge and the Beilan Pass, converge
in the plain of the Antioch Lake (<i>Balük Geut</i> or <i>El Bahr</i>) and are
met there by (1) the road from the Amanic Gates (Baghche Pass)
and western Commagene, which descends the valley of the Kara
Su, (2) the roads from eastern Commagene and the Euphratean
crossings at Samosata (Samsat) and Apamea Zeugma (Birejik),
which descend the valleys of the Afrin and the Kuwaik, and
(3) the road from the Euphratean ford at Thapsacus, which
skirts the fringe of the Syrian steppe. Travellers by all these
roads must proceed south by the single route of the Orontes
valley. Alexander is said to have camped on the site of Antioch,
and dedicated an altar to Zeus Bottiaeus, which lay in the north-west
of the future city. But the first western sovereign practically
to recognize the importance of the district was Antigonus,
who began to build a city, Antigonia, on the Kara Su a few miles
north of the situation of Antioch; but, on his defeat, he left it to
serve as a quarry for his rival Seleucus. The latter is said to
have appealed to augury to determine the exact site of his
projected foundation; but less fantastic considerations went far
to settle it. To build south of the river, and on and under the
last east spur of Casius, was to have security against invasion
from the north, and command of the abundant waters of the
mountain. One torrent, the Onopniktes (&ldquo;donkey-drowner&rdquo;),
flowed through the new city, and many other streams came down
a few miles west into the beautiful suburb of Daphne. The
site appears not to have been found wholly uninhabited. A
settlement, <i>Meroe</i>, boasting a shrine of Anait, called by the
Greeks the &ldquo;Persian Artemis,&rdquo; had long been located there,
and was ultimately included in the eastern suburbs of the new
city; and there seems to have been a village on the spur (Mt.
Silpius), of which we hear in late authors under the name <i>Io</i>,
or <i>Iopolis</i>. This name was always adduced as evidence by
Antiochenes (<i>e.g.</i> Libanius) anxious to affiliate themselves to
the Attic Ionians&mdash;an anxiety which is illustrated by the
Athenian types used on the city&rsquo;s coins. At any rate, Io may
have been a small early colony of trading Greeks (<i>Javan</i>).
John Malalas mentions also a village, Bottia, in the plain by
the river.</p>

<p>The original city of Seleucus was laid out in imitation of the
&ldquo;gridiron&rdquo; plan of Alexandria by the architect, Xenarius.
Libanius describes the first building and arrangement of this
city (i. p. 300. 17). The citadel was on Mt. Silpius and the city
lay mainly on the low ground to the north, fringing the river.
Two great colonnaded streets intersected in the centre. Shortly
afterwards a second quarter was laid out, probably on the east
and by Antiochus I., which, from an expression of Strabo,
appears to have been the native, as contrasted with the Greek,
town. It was enclosed by a wall of its own. In the Orontes,
north of the city, lay a large island, and on this Seleucus II.
Callinicus began a third walled &ldquo;city,&rdquo; which was finished
by Antiochus III. A fourth and last quarter was added
by Antiochus IV. Epiphanes (175-164 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>); and thenceforth
Antioch was known as <i>Tetrapolis</i>. From west to east the whole
was about 4 m. in diameter and little less from north to south,
this area including many large gardens. Of its population in
the Greek period we know nothing. In the 4th century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>
it was about 200,000 according to Chrysostom, who probably
did not reckon slaves. About 4 m. west and beyond the suburb,
Heraclea, lay the paradise of Daphne, a park of woods and
waters, in the midst of which rose a great temple to the Pythian
Apollo, founded by Seleucus I. and enriched with a cult-statue
of the god, as Musagetes, by Bryaxis. A companion sanctuary
of Hecate was constructed underground by Diocletian. The
beauty and the lax morals of Daphne were celebrated all over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page131" id="page131"></a>131</span>
the western world; and indeed Antioch as a whole shared in both
these titles to fame. Its amenities awoke both the enthusiasm
and the scorn of many writers of antiquity.</p>

<p>Antioch became the capital and court-city of the western
Seleucid empire under Antiochus I., its counterpart in the east
being Seleucia-on-Tigris; but its paramount importance dates
from the battle of Ancyra (240 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), which shifted the Seleucid
centre of gravity from Asia Minor, and led indirectly to the rise
of Pergamum. Thenceforward the Seleucids resided at Antioch
and treated it as their capital <i>par excellence</i>. We know little of it in the Greek period, apart from Syria (<i>q.v.</i>), all our information coming from authors of the late Roman time. Among
its great Greek buildings we hear only of the theatre, of which
substructures still remain on the flank of Silpius, and of the
royal palace, probably situated on the island. It enjoyed a
great reputation for letters and the arts (Cicero <i>pro Archia</i>, 3);
but the only names of distinction in these pursuits during the
Seleucid period, that have come down to us, are Apollophanes,
the Stoic, and one Phoebus, a writer on dreams. The mass
of the population seems to have been only superficially Hellenic,
and to have spoken Aramaic in non-official life. The nicknames
which they gave to their later kings were Aramaic; and, except
Apollo and Daphne, the great divinities of north Syria seem to
have remained essentially native, such as the &ldquo;Persian Artemis&rdquo;
of Meroe and Atargatis of Hierapolis Bambyce. We may infer,
from its epithet, &ldquo;Golden,&rdquo; that the external appearance of
Antioch was magnificent; but the city needed constant restoration
owing to the seismic disturbances to which the district
has always been peculiarly liable. The first great earthquake
is said by the native chronicler John Malalas, who tells us most
that we know of the city, to have occurred in 148 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and to
have done immense damage. The inhabitants were turbulent,
fickle and notoriously dissolute. In the many dissensions of
the Seleucid house they took violent part, and frequently rose
in rebellion, for example against Alexander Balas in 147 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>,
and Demetrius II. in 129. The latter, enlisting a body of Jews,
punished his capital with fire and sword. In the last struggles
of the Seleucid house, Antioch turned definitely against its feeble
rulers, invited Tigranes of Armenia to occupy the city in 83,
tried to unseat Antiochus XIII. in 65, and petitioned Rome
against his restoration in the following year. Its wish prevailed,
and it passed with Syria to the Roman Republic in 64 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, but
remained a <i>civitas libera</i>.</p>

<p>The Romans both felt and expressed boundless contempt for
the hybrid Antiochenes; but their emperors favoured the city
from the first, seeing in it a more suitable capital for the eastern
part of the empire than Alexandria could ever be, thanks to the
isolated position of Egypt. To a certain extent they tried to
make it an eastern Rome. Caesar visited it in 47 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and confirmed its
freedom. A great temple to Jupiter Capitolinus rose on Silpius, probably
at the instance of Octavian, whose cause the city had espoused. A forum
of Roman type was laid out. Tiberius built two long colonnades on the
south towards Silpius. Agrippa and Tiberius enlarged the theatre, and
Trajan finished their work. Antoninus Pius paved the great east to west
artery with granite. A circus, other colonnades and great numbers of
baths were built, and new aqueducts to supply them bore the names of
Caesars, the finest being the work of Hadrian. The Roman client, King
Herod, erected a long <i>stoa</i> on the east, and Agrippa encouraged the
growth of a new suburb south of this. Under the empire we chiefly hear
of the earthquakes which shook Antioch. One, in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 37, caused the
emperor Caligula to send two senators to report on the condition of the
city. Another followed in the next reign; and in 115, during Trajan&rsquo;s
sojourn in the place with his army of Parthia, the whole site was
convulsed, the landscape altered, and the emperor himself forced to take
shelter in the circus for several days. He and his successor restored
the city; but in 526, after minor shocks, the calamity returned in a
terrible form, and thousands of lives were lost, largely those of
Christians gathered to a great church assembly. We hear also of
especially terrific earthquakes on the 29th of November 528 and the 31st
of October 588.</p>

<p>At Antioch Germanicus died in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 19, and his body was burnt
in the forum. Titus set up the Cherubim, captured from the
Jewish temple, over one of the gates. Commodus had Olympic
games celebrated at Antioch, and in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 266 the town was suddenly
raided by the Persians, who slew many in the theatre. In 387 there was a
great sedition caused by a new tax levied by order of Theodosius, and
the city was punished by the loss of its
metropolitan status. Zeno, who renamed it Theopolis, restored
many of its public buildings just before the great earthquake
of 526, whose destructive work was completed by the Persian
Chosroes twelve years later. Justinian made an effort to revive
it, and Procopius describes his repairing of the walls; but its
glory was past.</p>

<p>The chief interest of Antioch under the empire lies in its
relation to Christianity. Evangelized perhaps by Peter, according
to the tradition upon which the Antiochene patriarchate still
rests its claim for primacy (cf. Acts xi.), and certainly by Barnabas
and Saul, its converts were the first to be called &ldquo;Christians.&rdquo;
They multiplied exceedingly, and by the time of Theodosius
were reckoned by Chrysostom at about 100,000 souls. Between
252 and 300 <span class="scs">A.D.</span> ten assemblies of the church were held at Antioch and
it became the residence of the patriarch of Asia. When Julian visited
the place in 362 the impudent population railed at him for his favour to
Jewish and pagan rites, and to
revenge itself for the closing of its great church of Constantine,
burned down the temple of Apollo in Daphne. The emperor&rsquo;s
rough and severe habits and his rigid administration prompted
Antiochene lampoons, to which he replied in the curious satiric
<i>apologia</i>, still extant, which he called <i>Misopogon</i>. His successor,
Valens, who endowed Antioch with a new forum having a statue of
Valentinian on a central column, reopened the great church, which stood
till the sack of Chosroes in 538. Antioch gave its name to a certain
school of Christian thought, distinguished by literal interpretation of
the Scriptures and insistence on the human limitations of Jesus.
Diodorus of Tarsus and Theodore of Mopsuestia were the leaders of this
school. The principal local saint was Simeon Stylites, who performed his
penance on a hill some 40 m. east. His body was brought to the city and
buried in a building erected under the emperor Leo. In <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 635, during
the reign of Heraclius, Antioch passed into Saracen hands, and decayed
apace for more than 300 years; but in 969 it was recovered for Byzantium
by Michael Burza and Peter the Eunuch. In 1084 the Seljuk Turks captured
it but held it only fourteen years, yielding place to the crusaders, who
besieged it for nine months, enduring frightful sufferings. Being at
last betrayed, it was given to Bohemund, prince of Tarentum, and it
remained the capital of a Latin principality for nearly two centuries.
It fell at last to the Egyptian, Bibars, in 1268, after a great
destruction and slaughter, from which it never revived. Little remains
now of the ancient city, except colossal ruins of aqueducts and part of
the Roman walls, which are used as quarries for modern Antakia; but no
scientific examination of the site has been made. A statue in the
Vatican and a silver statuette in the British Museum perpetuate the type
of its great effigy of the civic Fortune of Antioch&mdash;a majestic seated
figure, with Orontes as a youth issuing from under her feet.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Antakia,</span> the modern town, is still of considerable importance.
Pop. about 25,000, including Ansarieh, Jews, and a large body of
Christians of several denominations about 8000 strong. Though
superseded by Aleppo (<i>q.v.</i>) as capital of N. Syria, it is still the
centre of a large district, growing in wealth and productiveness with
the draining of its central lake, undertaken by a French company. The
principal cultures are tobacco, maize and cotton, and the mulberry for
silk production. Liquorice also is collected and exported. In 1822 (as
in 1872) Antakia suffered by earthquake, and when Ibrahim Pasha made it
his headquarters in 1835, it had only some 5000 inhabitants. Its hopes,
based on a Euphrates valley railway, which was to have started from its
port of Suedia (Seleucia), were doomed to disappointment, and it has
suffered repeatedly from visitations of cholera; but it has nevertheless
grown rapidly and will resume much of its old importance when a railway
is made down the lower Orontes valley. It is a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page132" id="page132"></a>132</span>
centre of American mission enterprise, and has a British vice-consul.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Synods of Antioch</span>. Beginning with three synods convened
between 264 and 269 in the matter of Paul of Samosata, more
than thirty councils were held in Antioch in ancient times.
Most of these dealt with phases of the Arian and of the Christological
controversies. The most celebrated took place in the
summer of 341 at the dedication of the golden Basilica, and is
therefore called <i>in encaeniis</i> (<span class="grk" title="en egkainiois">&#7952;&#957; &#7952;&#947;&#954;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#962;</span>), <i>in dedicatione</i>.
Nearly a hundred bishops were present, all from the Orient,
but the bishop of Rome was not represented. The emperor
Constantius attended in person. The council approved three
creeds (Hahn, §§ 153-155). Whether or no the so-called &ldquo;fourth
formula&rdquo; (Hahn, § 156) is to be ascribed to a continuation of this
synod or to a subsequent but distinct assembly of the same
year, its aim is like that of the first three; while repudiating
certain Arian formulas it avoids the Athanasian shibboleth
&ldquo;homoousios.&rdquo; The somewhat colourless compromise doubtless
proceeded from the party of Eusebius of Nicomedia, and proved
not inacceptable to the more nearly orthodox members of the
synod. The twenty-five canons adopted regulate the so-called
metropolitan constitution of the church. Ecclesiastical power is
vested chiefly in the metropolitan (later called archbishop), and
the semi-annual provincial synod (cf. Nicaea, canon 5), which he
summons and over which he presides. Consequently the powers of
country bishops (<i>chorepiscopi</i>) are curtailed, and direct recourse to
the emperor is forbidden. The sentence of one judicatory is to be
respected by other judicatories of equal rank; re-trial may take
place only before that authority to whom appeal regularly lies
(see canons 3, 4, 6). Without due invitation, a bishop may not
ordain, or in any other way interfere with affairs lying outside
his proper territory; nor may he appoint his own successor.
Penalties are set on the refusal to celebrate Easter in accordance
with the Nicene decree, as well as on leaving a church before the
service of the Eucharist is completed. The numerous objections
made by eminent scholars in past centuries to the ascription of
these twenty-five canons to the synod <i>in encaeniis</i> have been
elaborately stated and probably refuted by Hefele. The canons
formed part of the <i>Codex canonum</i> used at Chalcedon in 451 and
passed over into the later collections of East and West.</p>

including ruins of temples, a theatre and a fine aqueduct, were

was situated on the lower southern slopes of the Sultan Dagh,
in the Konia vilayet of Asia Minor, on the right bank of a stream,
the ancient Anthius, which flows into the Hoiran Geul. It was
probably founded on the site of a Phrygian sanctuary, by
Seleucus Nicator, before 280 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> and was made a free city by
the Romans in 189 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> It was a thoroughly Hellenized, Greek-speaking
city, in the midst of a Phrygian people, with a mixed
population that included many Jews. Before 6 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Augustus
made it a colony, with the title Caesarea, and it became the
centre of civil and military administration in south Galatia,
the romanization of which was progressing rapidly in the time of
Claudius, <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 41-54, when Paul visited it (Acts xiii. 14, xiv. 21,

<p><span class="bold">ANTIOCHUS OF ASCALON<a name="ar135" id="ar135"></a></span> (1st century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), Greek philosopher.
His philosophy consisted in an attempt to reconcile
the doctrines of his teachers Philo of Larissa and Mnesarchus
the Stoic. Against the scepticism of the former, he held that
the intellect has in itself a sufficient test of truth; against
Mnesarchus, that happiness, though its main factor is virtue,
depends also on outward circumstances. This electicism is
known as the Fifth Academy (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Academy, Greek</a></span>). His
writings are lost, and we are indebted for information to Cicero
(<i>Acad. Pr.</i> ii. 43), who studied under him at Athens, and Sextus
Empiricus (<i>Pyrrh. hyp.</i> i. 235). Antiochus lectured also in
Rome and Alexandria.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTIOPE.<a name="ar137" id="ar137"></a></span> (1) In Greek legend, the mother of Amphion and
Zethus, and, according to Homer (<i>Od</i>. xi. 260), a daughter of
the Boeotian river-god Asopus. In later poems she is called
the daughter of Nycteus or Lycurgus. Her beauty attracted
Zeus, who, assuming the form of a satyr, took her by force
(Apollodorus iii. 5). After this she was carried off by Epopeus,
king of Sicyon, who would not give her up till compelled by her
uncle Lycus. On the way home she gave birth, in the neighbourhood
of Eleutherae on Mount Cithaeron, to the twins Amphion
and Zethus, of whom Amphion was the son of the god, and
Zethus the son of Epopeus. Both were left to be brought up
by herdsmen. At Thebes Antiope now suffered from the persecution
of Dirce, the wife of Lycus, but at last escaped towards
Eleutherae, and there found shelter, unknowingly, in the house
where her two sons were living as herdsmen. Here she was
discovered by Dirce, who ordered the two young men to tie
her to the horns of a wild bull. They were about to obey, when
the old herdsman, who had brought them up, revealed his secret,
and they carried out the punishment on Dirce instead (Hyginus,
<i>Fab.</i> 8). For this, it is said, Dionysus, to whose worship Dirce
had been devoted, visited Antiope with madness, which caused
her to wander restlessly all over Greece till she was cured, and
married by Phocus of Tithorca, on Mount Parnassus, where
both were buried in one grave (Pausanias ix. 17, x. 32).</p>

<p>(2) A second Antiope, daughter of Ares, and sister of Hippolyte,
queen of the Amazons, was the wife of Theseus. There are
various accounts of the manner in which Theseus became
possessed of her, and of her subsequent fortunes. Either she
gave herself up to him out of love, when with Heracles he
captured Themiscyra, the seat of the Amazons, or she fell to
his lot as a captive (Diodorus iv. 16). Or again, Theseus himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page133" id="page133"></a>133</span>
invaded the dominion of the Amazons and carried her off, the
consequence of which was a counter-invasion of Attica by the
Amazons. After four months of war peace was made, and
Antiope left with Theseus as a peace-offering. According to
another account, she had joined the Amazons against him
because he had been untrue to her in desiring to marry Phaedra.
She is said to have been killed by another Amazon, Molpadia,
a rival in her affection for Theseus. Elsewhere it was believed
that he had himself killed her, and fulfilled an oracle to that effect
(Hyginus, <i>Fab</i>. 241). By Theseus she had a son, the well-known
Hippolytus (Plutarch, <i>Theseus</i>).</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTIPAROS<a name="ar139" id="ar139"></a></span> (anc. <i>Oliaros</i>), an island of the kingdom of Greece,
in the modern eparchy of Naxos, separated by a strait (about
1½ m. wide at the narrowest point) from the west coast of Pares.
It is 7 m. long by 3 broad, and contains about 700 inhabitants,
most of whom live in Kastro, a village on the north coast, and
are employed in agriculture and fishing. Formerly piracy was
common. The only remarkable feature in the island is a
stalactite cavern on the south coast, which is reached by a
narrow passage broken by two steep and dangerous descents
which are accomplished by the aid of rope-ladders. The grotto
itself, which is about 150 ft. by 100, and 50 ft. high (not all can
be seen from any part, and probably some portions are still
unexplored), shows many remarkable examples of stalactite
formations and incrustations of dazzling brilliance. It is not
mentioned by ancient writers; the first western traveller to
visit it was the marquis de Nointel (ambassador of Louis XIV.
to the Porte) who descended it with a numerous suite and held
high mass there on Christmas day 1673. There is, however, in
the entrance of the cavern an inscription recording the names
of visitors in ancient times.</p>

regent of Macedonia during Alexander&rsquo;s Eastern expedition
(334-323). He had previously (346) been sent as ambassador
by Philip to Athens and negotiated peace after the battle of
Chaeroneia (338). About 332 he set out against the rebellious
tribes of Thrace; but before this insurrection was quelled,
the Spartan king Agis had risen against Macedonia. Having
settled affairs in Thrace as well as he could, Antipater hastened
to the south, and in a battle near Megalopolis (331) gained a
complete victory over the insurgents (Diodorus xvii. 62). His
regency was greatly troubled by the ambition of Olympias,
mother of Alexander, and he was nominally superseded by
Craterus. But, on the death of Alexander in 323, he was, by the
first partition of the empire, left in command of Macedonia, and
in the Lamian War, at the battle of Crannon (322), crushed
the Greeks who had attempted to re-assert their independence.
Later in the same year he and Craterus were engaged in a
war against the Aetolians, when the news arrived from Asia
which induced Antipater to conclude peace with them; for
Antigonus reported that Perdiccas contemplated making himself
sole master of the empire. Antipater and Craterus accordingly
prepared for war against Perdiccas, and allied themselves
with Ptolemy, the governor of Egypt. Antipater crossed over
into Asia in 321; and while still in Syria, he received information
that Perdiccas had been murdered by his own soldiers. Craterus
fell in battle against Eumenes (Diodorus xviii. 25-39). Antipater,
now sole regent, made several new regulations, and having
quelled a mutiny of his troops and commissioned Antigonus to
continue the war against Eumenes and the other partisans of
Perdiccas, returned to Macedonia, where he arrived in 320
(Justin xiii. 6). Soon after he was seized by an illness which
terminated his active career, 319. Passing over his son Cassander,
he appointed the aged Polyperchon regent, a measure which gave
rise to much confusion and ill-feeling (Diodorus xvii., xviii).</p>

occasion of his trial. Fragments of his speech then delivered in

of two speeches for prosecution and defence&mdash;accusation,

in which the choir or congregation, being divided into two parts,
sing alternately. The peculiar structure of the Hebrew psalms
renders it probable that the antiphonal method originated in the
service of the ancient Jewish Church. According to the historian
Socrates, its introduction into Christian worship was due to
Ignatius (died 115 <span class="scs">A.D.</span>), who in a vision had seen the angels
singing in alternate choirs. In the Latin Church it was not
practised until more than two centuries later, when it was
introduced by Ambrose, bishop of Milan, who compiled an
antiphonary, or collection of words suitable for antiphonal
singing. The antiphonary still in use in the Roman Catholic
Church was compiled by Gregory the Great (590 <span class="scs">A.D.</span>).</p>

applied strictly to any two peoples or places on opposite sides
of the earth, so situated that a line drawn from the one to the
other passes through the centre of the globe and forms a true
diameter. Any two places having this relation&mdash;as London
and, approximately, Antipodes Island, near New Zealand&mdash;
must be distant from each other by 180° of longitude, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page134" id="page134"></a>134</span>
one must be as many degrees to the north of the equator as the
other is to the south, in other words, the latitudes are numerically
equal, but one is <i>north</i> and the other <i>south</i>. Noon at the one
place is midnight at the other, the longest day corresponds to
the shortest, and mid-winter is contemporaneous with midsummer.
In the calculation of days and nights, midnight on
the one side may be regarded as corresponding to the noon
either of the <i>previous</i> or of the <i>following</i> day. If a voyager sail
eastward, and thus anticipate the sun, his dating will be twelve
hours in advance, while the reckoning of another who has been
sailing westward will be as much in arrear. There will thus be
a difference of twenty-four hours between the two when they
meet. To avoid the confusion of dates which would thus arise,
it is necessary to determine a meridian at which dates should
be brought into agreement, <i>i.e.</i> a line the crossing of which would
involve the changing of the name of the day either forwards,
when proceeding westwards, or backwards, when proceeding
eastwards. Mariners have generally adopted the meridian 180°
from Greenwich, situated in the Pacific Ocean, as a convenient
line for co-ordinating dates. The so-called &ldquo;International Date
Line,&rdquo; which is, however, practically only due to American
initiative, is designed to remove certain objections to the meridian
of 180° W., the most important of which is that groups of islands
lying about this meridian differ in date by a day although only
a few miles apart. Several forms have been suggested; these
generally agree in retaining the meridian of 180° in the mid
Pacific, with a bend in the north in order to make the
Aleutian Islands and Alaska of the same time as America, and
also in the south so as to bring certain of the South Sea islands
into line with Australia and New Zealand.</p>

ester added. When the reaction is complete the acid is neutralized
with soda, and the phenyl methyl pyrazolone extracted
with ether and distilled <i>in vacuo</i>. The portion distilling at
about 200° C. is then methylated by means of methyl alcohol
and methyl iodide at 100-110° C., the excess of methyl alcohol
removed and the product obtained decolorized by sulphuric

of soda, and the oil which separates is removed by shaking with
benzene. The benzene layer on evaporation deposits the anti-pyrine
as a colourless crystalline solid which melts at 113° C. and
is soluble in water. It is basic in character, and gives a red
coloration on the addition of ferric chloride. In medicine anti-pyrine
(&ldquo;phenazonum&rdquo;) has been used as an analgesic and
antipyretic. The dose is 5-20 grs., but on account of its

Hearne in 1720 under the title <i>A Collection of Curious Discourses</i>,

antiquaries began to hold regular meetings for the discussion of
their hobby and in 1717 the Society of Antiquaries was formally
reconstituted, finally receiving a charter from George II. in 1751.
In 1780 George III. granted the society apartments in Somerset

<p><span class="bold">ANTI-SEMITISM.<a name="ar149" id="ar149"></a></span> In the political struggles of the concluding
quarter of the 19th century an important part was played by
a religious, political and social agitation against the Jews,
known as &ldquo;Anti-Semitism.&rdquo; The origins of this remarkable
movement already threaten to become obscured by legend.
The Jews contend that anti-Semitism is a mere atavistic revival
of the Jew-hatred of the middle ages. The extreme section of
the anti-Semites, who have given the movement its quasi-scientific
name, declare that it is a racial struggle&mdash;an incident
of the eternal conflict between Europe and Asia&mdash;and that the
anti-Semites are engaged in an effort to prevent what is called
the Aryan race from being subjugated by a Semitic immigration,
and to save Aryan ideals from being modified by an alien and
demoralizing oriental <i>Anschauung</i>. There is no essential foundation
for either of these contentions. Religious prejudices
reaching back to the dawn of history have been reawakened
by the anti-Semitic agitation, but they did not originate it,
and they have not entirely controlled it. The alleged racial
divergence is, too, only a linguistic hypothesis on the physical
evidence of which anthropologists are not agreed (Topinard,
<i>Anthropologie</i>, p. 444; Taylor, <i>Origins of Aryans</i>, cap. i.), and,
even if it were proved, it has existed in Europe for so many
centuries, and so many ethnic modifications have occurred on
both sides, that it cannot be accepted as a practical issue. It
is true that the ethnographical histories of the Jews and the
nations of Europe have proceeded on widely diverging lines,
but these lines have more than once crossed each other and
become interlaced. Thus Aryan elements are at the beginning of
both; European morals have been ineradicably semitized by
Christianity, and the Jews have been Europeans for over a
thousand years, during which their character has been modified
and in some respects transformed by the ecclesiastical and civil
polities of the nations among whom they have made their
permanent home. Anti-Semitism is then exclusively a question
of European politics, and its origin is to be found, not in the
long struggle between Europe and Asia, or between the Church
and the Synagogue, which filled so much of ancient and medieval
history, but in the social conditions resulting from the emancipation
of the Jews in the middle of the 19th century.</p>

<p>If the emancipated Jews were Europeans in virtue of the
antiquity of their western settlements, and of the character
impressed upon them by the circumstances of their European
history, they none the less presented the appearance of a strange
people to their Gentile fellow-countrymen. They had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page135" id="page135"></a>135</span>
secluded in their ghettos for centuries, and had consequently
acquired a physical and moral physiognomy differentiating
them in a measure from their former oppressors. This peculiar
physiognomy was, on its moral side, not essentially Jewish or
even Semitic. It was an advanced development of the main
attributes of civilized life, to which Christendom in its transition
from feudalism had as yet only imperfectly adapted itself. The
ghetto, which had been designed as a sort of quarantine to safeguard
Christendom against the Jewish heresy, had in fact proved
a storage chamber for a portion of the political and social forces
which were destined to sweep away the last traces of feudalism
from central Europe. In the ghetto, the pastoral Semite, who
had been made a wanderer by the destruction of his nationality,
was steadily trained, through centuries, to become an urban
European, with all the parasitic activities of urban economics,
and all the democratic tendencies of occidental industrialism.
Excluded from the army, the land, the trade corporations
and the artisan gilds, this quondam oriental peasant was gradually
transformed into a commercial middleman and a practised
dealer in money. Oppressed by the Church, and persecuted
by the State, his theocratic and monarchical traditions lost
their hold on his daily life, and he became saturated with a
passionate devotion to the ideals of democratic politics. Finally,
this former bucolic victim of Phoenician exploitation had his
wits preternaturally sharpened, partly by the stress of his
struggle for life, and partly by his being compelled in his urban
seclusion to seek for recreation in literary exercises, chiefly the
subtle dialectics of the Talmudists (Loeb, <i>Juif de l&rsquo;histoire</i>;
Jellinek, <i>Der Jüdische Stamm</i>). Thus, the Jew who emerged from
the ghetto was no longer a Palestinian Semite, but an essentially
modern European, who differed from his Christian fellow-countrymen
only in the circumstances that his religion was of the older
Semitic form, and that his physical type had become sharply
defined through a slightly more rigid exclusiveness in the matter
of marriages than that practised by Protestants and Roman
Catholics (Andree, <i>Volkskunde der Juden</i>, p. 58).</p>

<p>Unfortunately, these distinctive elements, though not very
serious in themselves, became strongly accentuated by concentration.
Had it been possible to distribute the emancipated
Jews uniformly throughout Christian society, as was the case
with other emancipated religious denominations, there would
have been no revival of the Jewish question. The Jews, however,
through no fault of their own, belonged to only one class in
European society&mdash;the industrial <i>bourgeoisie</i>. Into that class
all their strength was thrown, and owing to their ghetto preparation,
they rapidly took a leading place in it, politically and
socially. When the mid-century revolutions made the <i>bourgeoisie</i>
the ruling power in Europe, the semblance of a Hebrew domination
presented itself. It was the exaggeration of this apparent
domination, not by the <i>bourgeoisie</i> itself, but by its enemies
among the vanquished reactionaries on the one hand, and by
the extreme Radicals on the other, which created modern anti-Semitism
as a political force.</p>

<p>The movement took its rise in Germany and Austria. Here
the concentration of the Jews in one class of the population was
aggravated by their excessive numbers. While in France the
proportion to the total population was, in the early&rsquo;seventies,
0.14%, and in Italy, 0.12%, it was 1.22% in Germany, and
3.85% in Austria-Hungary; Berlin had 4.36% of Jews, and
Vienna 6.62% (Andree, <i>Volkskunde</i>, pp. 287, 291, 294, 295).
The activity of the Jews consequently manifested itself in a far
more intense form in these countries than elsewhere. This was
apparent even before the emancipations of 1848. Towards
the middle of the 18th century, a limited number of wealthy
<span class="sidenote">Germany.</span>
Jews had been tolerated as <i>Schutz-Juden</i> outside the
ghettos, and their sons, educated as Germans under
the influence of Moses Mendelssohn and his school (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jews</a></span>),
supplied a majority of the leading spirits of the revolutionary
agitation. To this period belong the formidable names of Ludwig
Börne (1786-1837), Heinrich Heine (1799-1854), Edward Ganz
(1798-1839), Gabriel Riesser (1806-1863), Ferdinand Lassalle
(1825-1864), Karl Marx (1818-1883), Moses Hess (1812-1875),
Ignatz Kuranda (1811-1884), and Johann Jacobi (1805-1877).
When the revolution was completed, and the Jews entered in a
body the national life of Germany and Austria, they sustained
this high average in all the intellectual branches of middle-class
activity. Here again, owing to the accidents of their history,
a further concentration became apparent. Their activity was
almost exclusively intellectual. The bulk of them flocked to
the financial and the distributive (as distinct from the productive)
fields of industry to which they had been confined in the ghettos.
The sharpened faculties of the younger generation at the same
time carried everything before them in the schools, with the
result that they soon crowded the professions, especially medicine,
law and journalism (Nossig, <i>Statistik des Jüd. Stammes</i>, pp. 33-37;
Jacobs, <i>Jew. Statistics</i>, pp. 41-69). Thus the &ldquo;Semitic domination,&rdquo;
as it was afterwards called, became every day more
strongly accentuated. If it was a long time in exciting resentment
and jealousy, the reason was that it was in no sense alien
to the new conditions of the national life. The competition was
a fair one. The Jews might be more successful than their
Christian fellow-citizens, but it was in virtue of qualities which
complied with the national standards of conduct. They were
as law-abiding and patriotic as they were intelligent. Crime
among them was far below the average (Nossig, p. 31). Their
complete assimilation of the national spirit was brilliantly
illustrated by the achievements in German literature, art and
science of such men as Heinrich Heine and Berthold Auerbach
(1812-1882), Felix Mendelssohn (-Bartholdy) (1809-1847), and
Jacob Meyerbeer (1794-1864), Karl Gustav Jacobi the mathematician
(1804-1851), Gabriel Gustav Valentin the physiologist
(1810-1883), and Moritz Lazarus (1824-1903) and Heymann
Steinthal (1823-1899) the national psychologists. In politics,
too, Edward Lasker (1829-1884) and Ludwig Bamberger (1823-1899)
had shown how Jews could put their country before party,
when, at the turning-point of German imperial history in 1866,
they led the secession from the <i>Fortschritts-Partei</i> and founded
the National Liberal party, which enabled Prince Bismarck
to accomplish German unity. Even their financiers were not
behind their Christian fellow-citizens in patriotism. Prince
Bismarck himself confessed that the money for carrying on the
1866 campaign was obtained from the Jewish banker Bleichroeder,
in face of the refusal of the money-market to support the
war. Hence the voice of the old Jew-hatred&mdash;for in a weak
way it was still occasionally heard in obscurantist corners&mdash;was
shamed into silence, and it was only in the European twilight&mdash;in
Russia and Rumania&mdash;and in lands where medievalism
still lingered, such as northern Africa and Persia, that oppression
and persecution continued to dog the steps of the Jews.</p>

<p>The signal for the change came in 1873, and was given unconsciously
by one of the most distinguished Jews of his time,
Edward Lasker, the gifted lieutenant of Bennigsen in the leadership
of the National Liberal party. The unification of Germany
in 1870, and the rapid payment of the enormous French war
indemnity, had given an unprecedented impulse to industrial
and financial activity throughout the empire. Money became
cheap and speculation universal. A company mania set in which
was favoured by the government, who granted railway and other
concessions with a prodigal hand. The inevitable result of this
state of things was first indicated by Jewish politicians and
economists. On the 14th of January 1873, Edward Lasker
called the attention of the Prussian diet to the dangers of the
situation, while his colleague, Ludwig Bamberger, in an able
article in the <i>Preussischen Jahrbücher</i>, condemned the policy
which had permitted the milliards to glut the country instead
of being paid on a plan which would have facilitated their gradual
digestion by the economic machinery of the nation. Deeply
impressed by the gravity of the impending crisis, Lasker instituted
a searching inquiry, with the result that he discovered a series
of grave company scandals in which financial promoters and
aristocratic directors were chiefly involved. Undeterred by the
fact that the leading spirit in these abuses, Bethel Henry Strousberg
(1823-1884), was a Jew, Lasker presented the results of
his inquiry to the diet on the 7th of February 1873, in a speech
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page136" id="page136"></a>136</span>
of great power and full of sensational disclosures. The dramatic
results of this speech need not be dwelt upon here (for details
see Blum, <i>Das deutsche Reich zur Zelt Bismarcks</i>, pp. 153-181).
It must suffice to say that in the following May the great Vienna
&ldquo;Krach&rdquo; occurred, and the colossal bubble of speculation
burst, bringing with it all the ruin foretold by Lasker and
Bamberger. From the position occupied by the Jews in the
commercial class, and especially in the financial section of that
class, it was inevitable that a considerable number of them should
figure in the scandals which followed. At this moment an obscure
Hamburg journalist, Wilhelm Marr, who as far back as 1862
had printed a still-born tract against the Jews (<i>Judenspiegel</i>),
published a sensational pamphlet entitled <i>Der Sieg des Judenthums
uber das Germanthum</i> (&ldquo;The Victory of Judaism over
Germanism&rdquo;). The book fell upon fruitful soil. It applied to
the nascent controversy a theory of nationality which, under
the great sponsorship of Hegel, had seized on the minds of the
German youth, and to which the stirring events of 1870 had
already given a deep practical significance. The state, according
to the Hegelians, should be rational, and the nation should
be a unit comprising individuals speaking the same language
and of the same racial origin. Heterogeneous elements might
be absorbed, but if they could not be reduced to the national
type they should be eliminated. This was the pseudo-scientific
note of the new anti-Semitism, the theory which differentiated
it from the old religious Jew-hatred and sought to give it a
rational place in modern thought. Marr&rsquo;s pamphlet, which
reviewed the facts of the Jewish social concentration without
noticing their essentially transitional character, proved the
pioneer of this teaching. It was, however, in the passions of
party politics that the new crusade found its chief sources of
vitality. The enemies of the <i>bourgeoisie</i> at once saw that the
movement was calculated to discredit and weaken the school
of Manchester Liberalism, then in the ascendant. Agrarian
capitalism, which had been dethroned by industrial capitalism
in 1848, and had burnt its fingers in 1873, seized the opportunity
of paying off old scores. The clericals, smarting under the
<i>Kutlturkampj</i>, which was supported by the whole body of Jewish
liberalism, joined eagerly in the new cry. In 1876 another
sensational pamphlet was published, Otto Glogau&rsquo;s <i>Die Börsen
und Grundergeschwindel in Berlin</i> (&ldquo;The Bourses and the
Company Swindles in Berlin&rdquo;), dealing in detail with the Jewish
participation in the scandals first revealed by Lasker. The
agitation gradually swelled, its growth being helped by the
sensitiveness and <i>cacoëthes scribendi</i> of the Jews themselves,
who contributed two pamphlets and a much larger proportion
of newspaper articles for every one supplied by their opponents
(Jacobs. <i>Bibliog. Jew. Question</i>, p. xi.). Up to 1879, however,
it was more of a literary than a political agitation, and was
generally regarded only as an ephemeral craze or a passing
spasm of popular passion.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1879 it spread with sudden fury over
the whole of Germany. This outburst, at a moment when no
new financial scandals or other illustrations of Semitic demoralization
and domination were before the public, has never been fully
explained. It is impossible to doubt, however, that the secret
springs of the new agitation were more or less directly supplied
by Prince Bismarck himself. Since 1877 the relations between
the chancellor and the National Liberals had gradually become
strained. The deficit in the budget had compelled the government
to think of new taxes, and in order to carry them through
the Reichstag the support of the National Liberals had been
solicited. Until then the National Liberals had faithfully
supported the chancellor in nursing the consolidation of the
new empire, but the great dream of its leaders, especially of
Lasker and Bamberger, who had learnt their politics in England,
was to obtain a constitutional and economic <i>régime</i> similar to
that of the British Isles. The organization of German unity
was now completed, and they regarded the new overtures of
Prince Bismarck as an opportunity for pressing their constitutional
demands. These were refused, the Reichstag was dissolved
and Prince Bismarck boldly came forward with a new fiscal
policy, a combination of protection and state socialism. Lasker
and Bamberger thereupon led a powerful secession of National
Liberals into opposition, and the chancellor was compelled to
seek a new majority among the ultra-Conservatives and the
Roman Catholic Centre. This was the beginning of the famous
&ldquo;journey to Canossa.&rdquo; Bismarck did not hide his mortification.
He began to recognize in anti-Semitism a means of &ldquo;dishing&rdquo;
the Judaized liberals, and to his creatures who assisted him in
his press campaigns he dropped significant hints in this sense
(Busch, <i>Bismarck</i>, ii. 453-454, iii. 16). He even spoke of a new
<i>Kulturkampf</i> against the Jews (<i>ibid</i>. ii. p. 484). How these
hints were acted upon has not been revealed, but it is sufficiently
instructive to notice that the final breach with the National
Liberals took place in July 1879, and that it was immediately
followed by a violent revival of the anti-Semitic agitation.
Marr&rsquo;s pamphlet was reprinted, and within a few months ran
through nine further editions. The historian Treitschke gave
the sanction of his great name to the movement. The Conservative
and Ultramontane press rang with the sins of the Jews.
In October an anti-Semitic league was founded in Berlin and
Dresden (for statutes of the league see <i>Nineteenth Century</i>,
February 1881, p. 344).</p>

<p>The leadership of the agitation was now definitely assumed by
a man who combined with social influence, oratorical power and
inexhaustible energy, a definite scheme of social regeneration and
an organization for carrying it out. This man was Adolf Stöcker
(b. 1835), one of the court preachers. He had embraced the
doctrines of Christian socialism which the Roman Catholics,
under the guidance of Archbishop Ketteler, had adopted from
the teachings of the Jew Lassalle (Nitti, <i>Catholic Socialism</i>, pp.
94-96, 122, 127), and he had formed a society called &ldquo;The
Christian Social Working-man&rsquo;s Union.&rdquo; He was also a conspicuous
member of the Prussian diet, where he sat and voted
with the Conservatives. He found himself in strong sympathy
with Prince Bismarck&rsquo;s new economic policy, which, although
also of Lassallian origin (Kohut, <i>Ferdinand Lassalle</i>, pp. 144 et
seq.), was claimed by its author as being essentially Christian
(Busch, p. 483). Under his auspices the years 1880-1881 became
a period of bitter and scandalous conflict with the Jews. The
Conservatives supported him, partly to satisfy their old grudges
against the Liberal <i>bourgeoisie</i> and partly because Christian
Socialism, with its anti-Semitic appeal to ignorant prejudice, was
likely to weaken the hold of the Social Democrats on the lower
classes. The Lutheran clergy followed suit, in order to prevent
the Roman Catholics from obtaining a monopoly of Christian
Socialism, while the Ultramontanes readily adopted anti-Semitism,
partly to maintain their monopoly, and partly to
avenge themselves on the Jewish and Liberal supporters of the
<i>Kulturkampf</i>. In this way a formidable body of public opinion
was recruited for the anti-Semites. Violent debates took place
in the Prussian diet. A petition to exclude the Jews from the
national schools and universities and to disable them from holding
public appointments was presented to Prince Bismarck. Jews
were boycotted and insulted. Duels between Jews and anti-Semites,
many of them fatal, became of daily occurrence. Even
unruly demonstrations and street riots were reported. Pamphlets
attacking every phase and aspect of Jewish life streamed by the
hundred from the printing-press. On their side the Jews did not
want for friends, and it was owing to the strong attitude adopted
by the Liberals that the agitation failed to secure legislative
fruition. The crown prince (afterwards Emperor Frederick) and
crown princess boldly set themselves at the head of the party
of protest. The crown prince publicly declared that the agitation
was &ldquo;a shame and a disgrace to Germany.&rdquo; A manifesto
denouncing the movement as a blot on German culture, a danger
to German unity and a flagrant injustice to the Jews themselves,
was signed by a long list of illustrious men, including Herr von
Forckenbeck, Professors Mommsen, Gneist, Droysen, Virchow,
and Dr Werner Siemens (<i>Times</i>, November 18, 1880). During
the Reichstag elections of 1881 the agitation played an active
part, but without much effect, although Stöcker was elected.
This was due to the fact that the great Conservative parties, so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page137" id="page137"></a>137</span>
far as their political organizations were concerned, still remained
chary of publicly identifying themselves with a movement which,
in its essence, was of socialistic tendency. Hence the electoral
returns of that year supplied no sure guide to the strength of
anti-Semitic opinion among the German people.</p>

<p>The first severe blow suffered by the German anti-Semites was
in 1881, when, to the indignation of the whole civilized world, the
barbarous riots against the Jews in Russia and the revival of the
medieval Blood Accusation in Hungary (see <i>infra</i>) illustrated
the liability of unreasoning mobs to carry into violent practice
the incendiary doctrines of the new Jew-haters. From this blow
anti-Semitism might have recovered had it not been for the
divisions and scandals in its own ranks, and the artificial forms it
subsequently assumed through factitious alliances with political
parties bent less on persecuting the Jews than on profiting by the
anti-Jewish agitation. The divisions showed themselves at the
first attempt to form a political party on an anti-Semitic basis.
Imperceptibly the agitators had grouped themselves into two
classes, economic and ethnological anti-Semites. The impracticable
racial views of Marr and Treitschke had not found
favour with Stöcker and the Christian Socialists. They were
disposed to leave the Jews in peace so long as they behaved
themselves properly, and although they carried on their agitation
against Jewish malpractices in a comprehensive form which
seemed superficially to identify them with the root-and-branch
anti-Semites, they were in reality not inclined to accept the racial
theory with its scheme of revived Jewish disabilities (Huret, <i>La
Question Sociale</i>&mdash;interview with Stöcker). This feeling was
strengthened by a tendency on the part of an extreme wing of
the racial anti-Semites to extend their campaign against Judaism
to its offspring, Christianity. In 1879 Professor Sepp, arguing
that Jesus was of no human race, had proposed that Christianity
should reject the Hebrew Scriptures and seek a fresh historical
basis in the cuneiform inscriptions. Later Dr Eugen Dübring, in
several brochures, notably <i>Die Judenfrage als Frage des
Rassencharakters</i> (1881, 5th ed. Berlin, 1901), had attacked Christianity
as a manifestation of the Semitic spirit which was not compatible
with the theological and ethical conceptions of the Scandinavian
peoples. The philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche had also adopted
the same view, without noticing that it was a <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>
of the whole agitation, in his <i>Menschliches, Allzumenschliches</i>
(1878), <i>Jenseits von Gut und Böse</i> (1886), <i>Genealogie der Moral</i>
(1887). With these tendencies the Christian Socialists could have
no sympathy, and the consequence was that when in March 1881
a political organization of anti-Semitism was attempted, two
rival bodies were created, the &ldquo;Deutsche Volksverein,&rdquo; under the
Conservative auspices of Herr Liebermann von Sonnenberg (b.
1848) and Herr Förster, and the &ldquo;Sociale Reichsverein,&rdquo; led by
the racial and Radical anti-Semites, Ernst Henrici (b. 1854) and
Otto Böckel (b. 1859). In 1886, at an anti-Semitic congress held
at Cassel a reunion was effected under the name of the &ldquo;Deutsche
antisemitische Verein,&rdquo; but this only lasted three years. In June
1889 the anti-Semitic Christian Socialists under Stöcker again
seceded.</p>

<p>Meanwhile racial anti-Semitism with its wholesale radical
proposals had been making considerable progress among the
ignorant lower classes. It adapted itself better to popular
passions and inherited prejudice than the more academic conceptions
of the Christian Socialists. The latter, too, were largely
Conservatives, and their points of contact with the proletariat
were at best artificial. Among the Hessian peasantry the
inflammatory appeals of Böckel secured many adherents. This
paved the way for a new anti-Semitic leader, Herrmann Ahlwardt
(b. 1846), who, towards the end of the &rsquo;eighties, eclipsed all the
other anti-Semites by the sensationalism and violence with which
he prosecuted the campaign. Ahlwardt was a person of evil
notoriety. He was loaded with debt. In the Manché decoration
scandals it was proved that he had acted first as a corrupt
intermediary and afterwards as the betrayer of his confederates.
His anti-Semitism was adopted originally as a means of <i>chantage</i>,
and it was only when it failed to yield profit in this form that he
came out boldly as an agitator. The wildness, unscrupulousness,
and full-bloodedness of his propaganda enchanted the mob, and
he bid fair to become a powerful democratic leader. His
pamphlets, full of scandalous revelations of alleged malpractices
of eminent Jews, were read with avidity. No fewer than ten of
them were written and published during 1892. Over and over
again he was prosecuted for libel and convicted, but this seemed
only to strengthen his influence with his followers. The Roman
Catholic clergy and newspapers helped to inflame the popular
passions. The result was that anti-Jewish riots broke out. At
Neustettin the Jewish synagogue was burnt, and at Xanten the
Blood Accusation was revived, and a Jewish butcher was tried
on the ancient charge of murdering a Christian child for ritual
purposes. The man was, of course, acquitted, but the symptoms
it revealed of reviving medievalism strongly stirred the liberal
and cultured mind of Germany. All protest, however, seemed
powerless, and the barbarian movement appeared destined to
carry everything before it.</p>

<p>German politics at this moment were in a very intricate state.
Prince Bismarck had retired, and Count Caprivi, with a programme
of general conciliation based on Liberal principles, was
in power. Alarmed by the non-renewal of the anti-Socialist law,
and by the conclusion of commercial treaties which made great
concessions to German industry, the landed gentry and the
Conservative party became alienated from the new chancellor.
In January 1892 the split was completed by the withdrawal by
the government of the Primary Education bill, which had been
designed to place primary instruction on a religious basis. The
Conservatives saw their opportunity of posing as the party of
Christianity against the Liberals and Socialists, who had wrecked
the bill, and they began to look towards Ahlwardt as a possible
ally. He had the advantages over Stöcker that he was not a
Socialist, and that he was prepared to lead his apparently large
following to assist the agrarian movement and weaken the Social
Democrats. The intrigue gradually came to light. Towards the
end of the year Herr Liebknecht, the Social Democratic leader,
denounced the Conservatives to the Reichstag as being concerned
&ldquo;in using the anti-Semitic movement as a bastard edition of
Socialism for the use of stupid people.&rdquo; (1st December). Two
days later the charge was confirmed. At a meeting of the party
held on the 3rd of December the following plank was added to
the Conservative programme: &ldquo;We combat the oppressive and
disintegrating Jewish influence on our national life; we demand
for our Christian people a Christian magistracy and Christian
teachers for Christian pupils; we repudiate the excesses of
anti-Semitism.&rdquo; In pursuance of the resolution Ahlwardt was returned
to the Reichstag at a by-election by the Conservative
district of Arnswalde-Friedeberg. The coalition was, however,
not yet completed. The intransigeant Conservatives, led by
Baron von Hammerstein, the editor of the <i>Kreuz-Zeitung</i>, justly
felt that the concluding sentence of the resolution of the 3rd of
December repudiating &ldquo;the excesses of anti-Semitism&rdquo; was
calculated to hinder a full and loyal co-operation between the two
parties. Accordingly on the 9th of December another meeting of
the party was summoned. Twelve hundred members met at the
Tivoli Hall in Berlin, and with only seven dissentients solemnly
expunged the offending sentence from the resolution. The
history of political parties may be searched in vain for a parallel
to this discreditable transaction.</p>

<p>The capture of the Conservative party proved the high-water
mark of German anti-Semitism. From that moment the tide
began to recede. All that was best in German national life was
scandalized by the cynical tactics of the Conservatives. The
emperor, strong Christian though he was, was shocked at the
idea of serving Christianity by a compact with unscrupulous
demagogues and ignorant fanatics. Prince Bismarck growled
out a stinging sarcasm from his retreat at Friedrichsruh. Even
Stöcker raised his voice in protest against the &ldquo;Ahlwardtismus&rdquo;
and &ldquo;Böckelianismus,&rdquo; and called upon his Conservative
colleagues to distinguish between &ldquo;respectable and disreputable
anti-Semitism.&rdquo; As for the Liberals and Socialists, they filled
the air with bitter laughter, and declared from the housetops that
the stupid party had at last been overwhelmed by its own
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page138" id="page138"></a>138</span>
stupidity. The Conservatives began to suspect that they had
made a false step, and they were confirmed in this belief by the
conduct of their new ally in the Reichstag. His debut in parliament
was the signal for a succession of disgraceful scenes. His
whole campaign of calumny was transferred to the floor of the
house, and for some weeks the Reichstag discussed little else than
his so-called revelations. The Conservatives listened to his wild
charges in uncomfortable silence, and refused to support him.
Stöcker opposed him in a violent speech. The Radicals and
Socialists, taking an accurate measure of the shallow vanity of
the man, adopted the policy of giving him &ldquo;enough rope.&rdquo;
Shortly after his election he was condemned to five months&rsquo;
imprisonment for libel, and he would have been arrested but for
the interposition of the Socialist party, including five Jews, who
claimed for him the immunities of a member of parliament.
When he moved for a commission to inquire into his revelations,
it was again the Socialist party which supported him, with the
result that all his charges, without exception, were found to be
absolutely baseless. Ahlwardt was covered with ridicule, and
when in May the Reichstag was dissolved, he was marched off to
prison to undergo the sentence for libel from which his parliamentary
privilege had up to that moment protected him.</p>

<p>His hold on the anti-Semitic populace was, however, not
diminished. On the contrary, the action of the Conservatives at
the Tivoli congress could not be at once eradicated from the
minds of the Conservative voters, and when the electoral campaign
began it was found impossible to explain to them that the
party leaders had changed their minds. The result was that
Ahlwardt, although in prison, was elected by two constituencies.
At Arnswalde-Friedeberg he was returned in the teeth of the
opposition of the official Conservatives, and at Neustettin he
defeated no less a person than his anti-Semitic opponent Stöcker.
Fifteen other anti-Semites, all of the Ahlwardtian school, were
elected. This, however, represented little in the way of political
influence; for henceforth the party had to stand alone as one of
the many minor factions in the Reichstag, avoided by all the great
parties, and too weak to exercise any influence on the main course
of affairs.</p>

<p>During the subsequent seven years it became more and more
discredited. The financial scandals connected with Förster&rsquo;s
attempt to found a Christian Socialist colony in Paraguay, the
conviction of Baron von Hammerstein, the anti-Semitic Conservative
leader, for forgery and swindling (1895-1896), and several
minor scandals of the same unsavoury character, covered the
party with the very obloquy which it had attempted to attach to
the Jews. At the same time the Christian Socialists who had
remained with the Conservative party also suffered. After the
elections of 1893, Stöcker was dismissed from his post of court
preacher, and publicly reprimanded for speaking familiarly of
the empress. Two years later the Christian Socialist, Pastor
Neumann, observing the tendency of the Conservatives to coalesce
with the moderate Liberals in antagonism to Social Democracy,
declared against the Conservative party. The following year
the emperor publicly condemned Christian Socialism and the
&ldquo;political pastors,&rdquo; and Stöcker was expelled from the Conservative
party for refusing to modify the socialistic propanganda of his
organ, <i>Das Volk</i>. His fall was completed by a quarrel with the
Evangelical Social Union. He left the Union and appealed to
the Lutheran clergy to found a new church social organization,
but met with no response. Another blow to anti-Semitism came
from the Roman Catholics. They had become alarmed by the
unbridled violence of the Ahlwardtians, and when in 1894
Förster declared in an address to the German anti-Semitic Union
that anarchical outrages like the murder of President Carnot were
as much due to the &ldquo;Anarchismus von oben&rdquo; as the &ldquo;Anarchismus
von unten,&rdquo; the Ultramontane <i>Germania</i> publicly washed its hands of the
Jew-baiters (1st of July 1894). Thus gradually German anti-Semitism
became stripped of every adventitious alliance; and at the general
election of 1898 it only managed to return twelve members to the
Reichstag, and in 1903 its party strength fell to nine. A remarkable
revival in its fortunes, however, took place between 1905 and 1907.
Identifying itself with the extreme Chauvinists and Anglophobes it
profited by the anti-national errors of the Clericals and Socialists,
and won no fewer than twelve by-elections. At the general election of
1907 its jingoism and aggressive Protestantism were rewarded with
twenty-five seats. It is clear, however, from the figures of the second
ballots that these successes owed far more to the tendencies of the
party in the field of general politics than to its anti-Semitism. Indeed
the specifically anti-Semitic movement has shown little activity since
1893.</p>

<p>The causes of the decline of German anti-Semitism are not
difficult to determine. While it remained a theory of nationality
and a fad of the metaphysicians, it made considerable noise in the
world, but without exercising much practical influence. When
it attempted to play an active part in politics it became submerged
by the ignorant and superstitious voters, who could not
understand its scientific justification, but who were quite ready
to declaim and riot against the Jew bogey. It thus became a sort
of Jacquerie which, being exploited by unscrupulous demagogues,
soon alienated all its respectable elements. Its moments of real
importance have been due not to inherent strength but to the
uses made of it by other political parties for their own purposes.
These coalitions are no longer of perilous significance so far as the
Jews are concerned, chiefly because, in face of the menace of
democratic socialism and its unholy alliance with the Roman
Catholic Centrum, all supporters of the present organization of
society have found it necessary to sink their differences. The new
social struggle has eclipsed the racial theory of nationality. The
Social Democrat became the enemy, and the new reaction counted
on the support of the rich Jews and the strongly individualist
Jewish middle class to assist it in preserving the existing social
structure. Hence in Prince Billow&rsquo;s &ldquo;Bloc&rdquo; (1908) anti-Semites
figured side by side with Judeophil Radicals.</p>

<p>More serious have been the effects of German anti-Semitic teachings on
the political and social life of the countries adjacent to the
empire&mdash;Russia, Austria and France. In Russia these effects were first
seriously felt owing to the fury of autocratic reaction to which the
<span class="sidenote">Russia.</span>
tragic death of the tsar Alexander II. gave rise. This, however, like
the Strousberg <i>Krach</i> in Germany, was only the proximate cause of the
outbreak. There were other elements which had created a <i>milieu</i>
peculiarly favourable to the transplantation of the German craze.
In the first place the medieval anti-Semitism was still an integral
part of the polity of the empire. The Jews were cooped up in one
huge ghetto in the western provinces, &ldquo;marked out to all their
fellow-countrymen as aliens, and a pariah caste set apart for
special and degrading treatment&rdquo; (<i>Persecution of the Jews in
Russia</i>, 1891, p.5). In the next place, owing to the emancipation
of the serfs which had half ruined the landowners, while creating
a free but moneyless peasantry, the Jews, who could be neither
nobles nor peasants, had found a vocation as money-lenders
and as middlemen between the grain producers, and the grain
consumers and exporters. There is no evidence that this function
was performed, as a rule, in an exorbitant or oppressive way.
On the contrary, the fall in the value of cereals on all the provincial
markets, after the riots of 1881, shows that the Jewish competition had
previously assured full prices to the farmers (Schwabacher,
<i>Denkschrift</i>, 1882, p. 27). Nevertheless, the Jewish activity or
&ldquo;exploitation,&rdquo; as it was called, was resented, and
the ill-feeling it caused among landowners and farmers was
shared by non-Jewish middlemen and merchants who had thereby
been compelled to be satisfied with small profits. Still there was
but little thought of seeking a remedy in an organized anti-Jewish
movement. On the contrary, the abnormal situation aggravated by the
disappointments and depression caused by the Turkish war, had stimulated
a widespread demand for constitutional changes which would enable the
people to adopt a state-machinery more exactly suited to their needs.
Among the peasantry this demand was promoted and fomented by the
Nihilists, and among the landowners it was largely adopted as a means of
checking what threatened to become a new Jacquerie (Walcker,
<i>Gegertwärtige Lage Russlands</i>, 1873; <i>Innere Krisis Russlands</i>, 1876).
The tsar, Alexander II., strongly sympathized
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page139" id="page139"></a>139</span>
with this movement, and on the advice of Count Loris-Melikov
and the council of ministers a rudimentary scheme of parliamentary
government had been drafted and actually signed when
the emperor was assassinated. Meanwhile a nationalist and reactionary
agitation, originating like its German analogue in the
Hegelianism of a section of the lettered public, had manifested
itself in Moscow. After some early vicissitudes, it had been
organized, under the auspices of Alexis Kireiev, Chomyakov,
Aksakov and Kochelev, into the Slavophil party, with a
Romanticist programme of reforms based on the old traditions
of the pre-Petrine epoch. This party gave a great impetus to
Slav nationalism. Its final possibilities were sanguinarily
illustrated by Muraviev&rsquo;s campaign in Poland in 1863, and
in the war against Turkey in 1877, which was exclusively its
handiwork (Statement by General Kireiev: Schütz, <i>Das heutige
Russland</i>, p. 104). After the assassination of Alexander II. the
Slavophil teaching, as expounded by Ignatiev and Pobêdonostsev,
became paramount in the government, and the new tsar
was persuaded to cancel the constitutional project of his father.
The more liberal views of a section of the Slavophils under
Aksakov, who had been in favour of representative institutions
on traditional lines, were displaced by the reactionary system of
Pobêdonostsev, who took his stand on absolutism, orthodoxy
and the racial unity of the Russian people. This was the situation
on the eve of Easter 1881. The hardening nationalism
above, the increasing discontent below, the economic activity of
the Hebrew heretics and aliens, and the echoes of anti-Semitism
from over the western border were combining for an explosion.</p>

<p>A scuffle in a tavern at Elisabethgrad in Kherson sufficed
to ignite this combustible material. The scuffle grew into a
riot, the tavern was sacked, and the drunken mob, hounded on
by agitators who declared that the Jews were using Christian
blood for the manufacture of their Easter bread, attacked and
looted the Jewish quarter. The outbreak spread rapidly. On
the 7th of May there was a similar riot at Smiela, near Cherkasy,
and the following day there was a violent outbreak at Kiev,
which left 2000 Jews homeless. Within a few weeks the whole of
western Russia, from the Black Sea to the Baltic, was smoking
with the ruins of Jewish homes. Scores of Jewish women were
dishonoured, hundreds of men, women and children were
slaughtered, and tens of thousands were reduced to beggary and
left without a shelter. Murderous riots or incendiary outrages
took place in no fewer than 167 towns and villages, including
Warsaw, Odessa and Kiev. Europe had witnessed no such
scenes of mob savagery since the Black Death massacres in the
14th century. As the facts gradually filtered through to the
western capitals they caused a thrill of horror everywhere.
An indignation meeting held at the Mansion House in London,
under the presidency of the lord mayor, was the signal for a long
series of popular demonstrations condemning the persecutions,
held in most of the chief cities of England and the continent.</p>

<p>Except as stimulated by the Judeophobe revival in Germany
the Russian outbreak in its earlier forms does not belong specifically
to modern anti-Semitism. It was essentially a medieval
uprising animated by the religious fanaticism, gross superstition
and predatory instincts of a people still in the medieval stage
of their development. This is proved by the fact that, although
the Russian peasant was supposed to be a victim of unbearable
Jewish &ldquo;exploitation,&rdquo; he was not moved to riot until he had
been brutalized by drink and excited by the old fable of the
Blood Accusation. The modern anti-Semitic element came
from above and followed closely on the heels of the riots. It
has been freely charged against the Russian government that it
promoted the riots in 1881 in order to distract popular attention
from the Nihilist propaganda and from the political disappointments
involved in the cancellation of the previous tsar&rsquo;s constitutional
project (Lazare, <i>L&rsquo;Antisémitisme</i>, p. 211). This seems
to be true of General Ignatiev, then minister of the interior, and
the secret police (Séménoff, <i>The Russian Government and the
Massacres</i>, pp. 17, 32, 241). It is certain that the local authorities,
both civil and military, favoured the outbreak, and took no
steps to suppress it, and that the feudal bureaucracy who had
just escaped a great danger were not sorry to see the discontented
populace venting their passions on the Jews. In the higher
circles of the government, however, other views prevailed. The
tsar himself was at first persuaded that the riots were the work
of Nihilists, and he publicly promised his protection to the Jews.
On the other hand, his ministers, ardent Slavophils, thought
they recognized in the outbreak an endorsement of the nationalist
teaching of which they were the apostles, and, while reprobating
the acts of violence, came to the conclusion that the most reasonable
solution was to aggravate the legal disabilities of the persecuted
aliens and heretics. To this view the tsar was won over,
partly by the clamorous indignation of western Europe, which
had wounded his national <i>amour propre</i> to the quick, and partly
by the strongly partisan report of a commission appointed
to inquire, not into the administrative complaisance which had
allowed riot to run loose over the western and southern provinces,
but into the &ldquo;exploitation&rdquo; alleged against the Jews, the
reasons why &ldquo;the former laws limiting the rights of the Jews&rdquo;
had been mitigated, and how these laws could be altered so as
&ldquo;to stop the pernicious conduct of the Jews&rdquo; (Rescript of the
3rd of September 1881). The result of this report was the
drafting of a &ldquo;Temporary Order concerning the Jews&rdquo; by the
minister of the interior, which received the assent of the tsar
on the 3rd of May 1882. This order, which was so little temporary
that it has not yet been repealed, had the effect of creating a
number of fresh ghettos within the pale of Jewish settlement.
The Jews were cooped up within the towns, and their rural
interests were arbitrarily confiscated. The doubtful incidence
of the order gave rise to a number of judgments of the senate,
by which all its persecuting possibilities were brought out, with
the result that the activities of the Jews were completely paralysed,
and they became a prey to unparalleled cruelty. As the
gruesome effect of this legislation became known, a fresh outburst
of horror and indignation swelled up from western Europe. It
proved powerless. Count Ignatiev was dismissed owing to the
protests of high-placed Russians, who were disgusted by the new
<i>Kulturkampf</i>, but his work remained, and, under the influence
of Pobêdonostsev, the procurator of the Holy Synod, the policy
of the &ldquo;May Laws,&rdquo; as they were significantly called, was applied
to every aspect of Jewish life with pitiless rigour. The temper of
the tsar may be judged by the fact that when an appeal for mercy
from an illustrious personage in England was conveyed to him at
Fredensborg through the gracious medium of the tsaritsa, he
angrily exclaimed within the hearing of an Englishman in the
ante-room who was the bearer of the message, &ldquo;Never let me
hear you mention the name of that people again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The Russian May Laws are the most conspicuous legislative
monument achieved by modern anti-Semitism. It is true
that they re-enacted regulations which resemble the oppressive
statutes introduced into Poland through the influence of the
Jesuits in the 16th century (Sternberg, <i>Gesch. d. Juden in Polen</i>,
pp. 141 et seq.), but their Orthodox authors were as little conscious
of this irony of history as they were of the Teutonic
origins of the whole Slavophil movement. These laws are an
experimental application of the political principles extracted by
Marr and his German disciples from the metaphysics of Hegel,
and as such they afford a valuable means of testing the practical
operation of modern anti-Semitism. Their result was a widespread
commercial depression which was felt all over the empire.
Even before the May Laws were definitely promulgated the
passport registers showed that the anti-Semitic movement had
driven 67,900 Jews across the frontier, and it was estimated
that they had taken with them 13,000,000 roubles, representing a
minimum loss of 60,000,000 roubles to the annual turnover of
the country&rsquo;s trade. Towards the end of 1882 it was calculated
that the agitation had cost Russia as much as the whole Turkish
war of 1877. Trade was everywhere paralysed. The enormous
increase of bankruptcies, the transfer of investments to foreign
funds, the consequent fall in the value of the rouble and the
prices of Russian stocks, the suspension of farming operations
owing to advances on growing crops being no longer available,
the rise in the prices of the necessaries of life, and lastly, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page140" id="page140"></a>140</span>
appearance of famine, filled half the empire with gloom. Banks
closed their doors, and the great provincial fairs proved failures.
When it was proposed to expel the Jews from Moscow there was
a loud outcry all over the sacred city, and even the Orthodox
merchants, realizing that the measure would ruin their flourishing
trade with the south and west, petitioned against it. The Moscow
Exhibition proved a failure. Nevertheless the government persisted
with its harsh policy, and Jewish refugees streamed by
tens of thousands across the western frontier to seek an asylum
in other lands. In 1891 the alarm caused by this emigration led
to further protests from abroad. The citizens of London again
assembled at Guildhall, and addressed a petition to the tsar on
behalf of his Hebrew subjects. It was handed back to the lord
mayor by the Russian ambassador, with a curt intimation that
the emperor declined to receive it. At the same time orders were
defiantly given that the May Laws should be strictly enforced.
Meanwhile the Russian minister of finance was at his wits&rsquo; ends
for money. Negotiations for a large loan had been entered upon
with the house of Rothschild, and a preliminary contract had
been signed, when, at the instance of the London firm, M.
Wyshnigradski, the finance minister, was informed that unless
the persecutions of the Jews were stopped the great banking-house
would be compelled to withdraw from the operation.
Deeply mortified by this attempt to deal with him <i>de puissance à
puissance</i>, the tsar peremptorily broke off the negotiations, and
ordered that overtures should be made to a non-Jewish French
syndicate. In this way anti-Semitism, which had already so
profoundly influenced the domestic politics of Europe, set its
mark on the international relations of the powers, for it was
the urgent need of the Russian treasury quite as much as the
termination of Prince Bismarck&rsquo;s secret treaty of mutual neutrality
which brought about the Franco-Russian alliance (Daudet,
<i>Hist. Dipl. de l&rsquo;Alliance Franco-Russe</i>, pp. 259 et. seq.).</p>

<p>For nearly three years more the persecutions continued.
Elated by the success of his crusade against the Jews, Pobêdonostsev
extended his persecuting policy to other non-Orthodox
denominations. The legislation against the Protestant Stundists
became almost as unbearable as that imposed on the Jews. In
the report of the Holy Synod, presented to the tsar towards the
end of 1893, the procurator called for repressive measures against
Roman Catholics, Moslems and Buddhists, and denounced the
rationalist tendency of the whole system of secular education in
the empire (<i>Neue Freie Presse</i>, 31st January 1894). A year later,
however, the tsar died, and his successor, without repealing any
of the persecuting laws, let it gradually be understood that their
rigorous application might be mitigated. The country was tired
and exhausted by the persecution, and the tolerant hints which
came from high quarters were acted upon with significant alacrity.</p>

<p>A new era of conflict dawned with the great constitutional
struggle towards the end of the century. The conditions, however,
were very different from those which prevailed in the &rsquo;eighties.
The May Laws had avenged themselves with singular fitness. By
confining the Jews to the towns at the very moment that Count
Witte&rsquo;s policy of protection was creating an enormous industrial
proletariat they placed at the disposal of the disaffected masses
an ally powerful in numbers and intelligence, and especially in its
bitter sense of wrong, its reckless despair and its cosmopolitan
outlook and connexions. As early as 1885 the Jewish workmen
assisted by Jewish university students led the way in the
formation of trades unions. They also became the <i>colporteurs</i> of
western European socialism, and they played an important part
in the organization of the Russian Social Democratic Federation
which their &ldquo;Arbeiter Bund&rdquo; joined in 1898 with no fewer than
30,000 members. The Jewish element in the new democratic
movement excited the resentment of the government, and under
the minister of the interior, M. Sipiaguine, the persecuting laws
were once more rigorously enforced. The &ldquo;Bund&rdquo; replied in
1901 by proclaiming itself frankly political and revolutionary,
and at once took a leading place in the revolutionary movement.
The reactionaries were not slow to profit by this circumstance.
With the support of M. Plehve, the new minister of the interior,
and the whole of the bureaucratic class they denounced the
revolution as a Jewish conspiracy, engineered for exclusively
Jewish purposes and designed to establish a Jewish domination
over the Russian people. The government and even the intimates
of the tsar became persuaded that only by the terrorization of
the Jews could the revolutionary movement be effectually dealt
with. For this purpose a so-called League of True Russians was
formed. Under high patronage, and with the assistance of the
secret police and a large number of the local authorities, it set
itself to stir up the populace, chiefly the fanatics and the hooligans,
against the Jews. Incendiary proclamations were prepared and
printed in the ministry of the interior itself, and were circulated
by the provincial governors and the police (Prince Urussov&rsquo;s
speech in the Duma, June 8 (21), 1906). The result was another
series of massacres which began at Kishinev in 1903 and culminated
in wholesale butchery at Odessa and Bielostok in October
1905. An attempt was made to picture and excuse these
outbreaks as a national upheaval against the Jew-made revolution
but it failed. They only embittered the revolutionists and
&ldquo;intellectuals&rdquo; throughout the country, and won for them a
great deal of outspoken sympathy abroad. The artificiality of
the anti-Jewish outbreak was illustrated by the first Duma
elections. Thirteen Jews were elected and every constituency
which had been the scene of a <i>pogrom</i> returned a liberal member.
Unfortunately the Jews benefited little by the new parliamentary
constitution. The privileges of voting for members of the Duma
and of sitting in the new assembly were granted them, but all
their civil and religious disabilities were maintained. Both the
first and the second Duma proposed to emancipate them, but
they were dissolved before any action could be taken. By the
modification of the electoral law under which the third Duma was
elected the voting power of the Jews was diminished and further
restrictions were imposed upon them through official intimidation
during the elections. The result was that only two Jews were
elected, while the reactionary tendency of the new electorate
virtually removed the question of their emancipation from the
field of practical politics.</p>

<p>The only other country in Europe in which a legalized anti-Semitism
exists is Rumania. The conditions are very similar to
those which obtain in Russia, with the important
difference that Rumania is a constitutional country,
<span class="sidenote">Rumania.</span>
and that the Jewish persecutions are the work of the elected
deputies of the nation. Like the <i>Bourgeois Gentilhomme</i> who
wrote prose all his life without knowing it, the Rumanians
practised the nationalist doctrines of the Hegelian anti-Semites
unconsciously long before they were formulated in Germany. In
the old days of Turkish domination the lot of the Rumanian Jews
was not conspicuously unhappy. It was only when the nation
began to be emancipated, and the struggle in the East assumed
the form of a crusade against Islam that the Jews were persecuted.
Rumanian politicians preached a nationalism limited exclusively
to indigenous Christians, and they were strongly supported by all
who felt the commercial competition of the Jews. Thus, although
the Jews had been settled in the land for many centuries,
they were by law declared aliens. This was done in defiance of
the treaty of Paris of 1856 and the convention of 1858 which
declared all Rumans to be equal before the law. Under the
influence of this distinction the Jews became persecuted, and
sanguinary riots were of frequent occurrence. The realization
of a Jewish question led to legislation imposing disabilities on the
Jews. In 1878 the congress of Berlin agreed to recognize the
independence of Rumania on condition that all religious disabilities
were removed. Rumania agreed to this condition, but
ultimately persuaded the powers to allow her to carry out the
emancipation of the Jews gradually. Persecutions, however,
continued, and in 1902 they led to a great exodus of Jews. The
United States addressed a strong remonstrance to the Rumanian
government, but the condition of the Jews was in no way improved.
Their emancipation was in 1908 as far off as ever, and
their disabilities heavier than those of their brethren in Russia.
For this state of things the example of the anti-Semites in
Germany, Russia, Austria and France was largely to blame, since
it had justified the intolerance of the Rumans. Owing, also, to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page141" id="page141"></a>141</span>
the fact that of late years Rumania had become a sort of <i>annexe</i>
of the Triple Alliance, it was found impossible to induce the
signatories of the treaty of Berlin to take action to compel the
state to fulfil its obligations under that treaty.</p>

<p>In Austria-Hungary the anti-Semitic impulses came almost
simultaneously from the North and East. Already in the
&rsquo;seventies the doctrinaire anti-Semitism of Berlin had
found an echo in Budapest. Two members of the diet,
<span class="sidenote">Austria-Hungary.</span>
Victor Istoczy and Geza Onody, together with a
publicist named Georg Marczianyi, busied themselves in making
known the doctrine of Marr in Hungary. Marczianyi, who
translated the German Judeophobe pamphlets into Magyar, and
the Magyar works of Onody into German, was the chief medium
between the northern and southern schools. In 1880 Istoczy
tried to establish a &ldquo;Nichtjuden Bund&rdquo; in Hungary, with
statutes literally translated from those of the German anti-Semitic
league. The movement, however, made no progress,
owing to the stalwart Liberalism of the predominant political
parties, and of the national principles inherited from the revolution
of 1848. The large part played by the Jews in that struggle,
and the fruitful patriotism with which they had worked for the
political and economic progress of the country, had created, too,
a strong claim on the gratitude of the best elements in the nation.
Nevertheless, among the ultramontane clergy, the higher aristocracy,
the ill-paid minor officials, and the ignorant peasantry, the
seeds of a tacit anti-Semitism were latent. It was probably
the aversion of the nobility from anything in the nature of a
demagogic agitation which for a time prevented these seeds
from germinating. The news of the uprising in Russia and the
appearance of Jewish refugees on the frontier, had the effect of
giving a certain prominence to the agitation of Istoczy and Onody
and of exciting the rural communities, but it did not succeed in
impressing the public with the pseudo-scientific doctrines of the
new anti-Semitism. It was not until the agitators resorted to
the Blood Accusation&mdash;that never-failing decoy of obscurantism
and superstition&mdash;that Hungary took a definite place in the
anti-Semitic movement. The outbreak was short and fortunately bloodless,
but while it lasted its scandals shocked the whole of Europe.</p>

<p>Dr August Rohling, professor of Hebrew at the university of
Prague, a Roman Catholic theologian of high position but
dubious learning, had for some years assisted the Hungarian
anti-Semites with <i>réchauffés</i> of Eisenmenger&rsquo;s <i>Enidecktes Judenthum</i>
(Frankfurt a/M. 1700). In 1881 he made a solemn deposition
before the Supreme Court accusing the Jews of being bound by
their law to work the moral and physical ruin of non-Jews. He
followed this up with an offer to depose on oath that the murder
of Christians for ritual purposes was a doctrine secretly taught
among Jews. Professor Delitzsch and other eminent Hebraists,
both Christian and Jewish, exposed and denounced the ignorance
and malevolence of Rohling, but were unable to stem the mischief
he was causing. In April 1882 a Christian girl named Esther
Sobymossi was missed from the Hungarian village of Tisza
Eszlar, where a small community of Jews were settled. The
rumour got abroad that she had been kidnapped and murdered
by the Jews, but it remained the burden of idle gossip, and gave
rise to neither judicial complaint nor public disorders. At this
moment the question of the Bosnian Pacification credits was
before the diet. The unpopularity of the task assumed by
Austria-Hungary, under the treaty of Berlin, which was calculated
to strengthen the disaffected Croat element in the empire,
had reduced the government majority to very small proportions,
and all the reactionary factions in the country were accordingly
in arms. The government was violently and unscrupulously
attacked on all sides. On the 23rd of May there was a debate
in the diet when M. Onody, in an incendiary harangue, told the
story of the missing girl at Tisza Eszlar, and accused ministers
of criminal indulgence to races alien to the national spirit. In
the then excited state of the public mind on the Croat question,
the manoeuvre was adroitly conceived. The government fell
into the trap, and treated the story with lofty disdain. Thereupon
the anti-Semites set to work on the case, and M. Joseph
Bary, the magistrate at Nyiregyhaza, and a noted anti-Semite,
was induced to go to Tisza Eszlar and institute an inquiry. All
the anti-liberal elements in the country now became banded
together in this effort to discredit the liberal government, and
for the first time the Hungarian anti-Semites found themselves
at the head of a powerful party. Fifteen Jews were arrested and
thrown into prison. No pains were spared in preparing the case
for trial. Perjury and even forgery were freely resorted to.
The son of one of the accused, a boy of fourteen, was taken into
custody by the police, and by threats and cajoleries prevailed
upon to give evidence for the prosecution. He was elaborately
coached for the terrible <i>rôle</i> he was to play. The trial opened at
Nyiregyhaza on the 19th of June, and lasted till the 3rd of August.
It was one of the most dramatic <i>causes celèbres</i> of the century.
Under the brilliant cross-examination of the advocates for the
defence the whole of the shocking conspiracy was gradually
exposed. The public prosecutor thereupon withdrew from the
case, and the four judges&mdash;the chief of whom held strong anti-Semitic
opinions&mdash;unanimously acquitted all the prisoners.
The case proved the death-blow of Hungarian anti-Semitism.
Although another phase of the Jewish question, which will be
referred to presently, had still to occupy the public mind, the
shame brought on the nation by the Tisza Eszlar conspiracy
effectually prevented the anti-Semites from raising their voices
with any effect again.</p>

<p>Meanwhile a more formidable and complicated outburst was
preparing in Austria itself. Here the lines of the German agitation
were closely followed, but with far more dramatic results.
It was exclusively political&mdash;that is to say, it appealed to
anti-Jewish prejudices for party purposes while it sought to rehabilitate
them on a pseudo-scientific basis, racial and economic.
At first it was confined to sporadic pamphleteers. By their side
there gradually grew up a school of Christian Socialists, recruited
from the ultra-Clericals, for the study and application of the
doctrines preached at Mainz by Archbishop Ketteler. This
constituted a complete Austrian analogue to the Evangelical-Socialist
movement started in Germany by Herr Stöcker. For
some years the two movements remained distinct, but signs of
approximation were early visible. Thus one of the first complaints
of the anti-Semites was that the Jews were becoming
masters of the soil. This found an echo in the agrarian principles
of the Christian Socialists, as expounded by Rudolph Meyer,
in which individualism in landed property was admitted on the
condition that the landowners were &ldquo;the families of the nation&rdquo;
and not &ldquo;cosmopolitan financiers.&rdquo; A further indication of
anti-Semitism is found in a speech delivered in 1878 by Prince Alois
von Liechtenstein (b. 1846), the most prominent disciple of
Rudolph Meyer, who denounced the national debt as a tribute
paid by the state to cosmopolitan rentiers (Nitti, <i>Catholic Socialism</i>,
pp. 200, 201, 211, 216). The growing disorder in parliament,
due to the bitter struggle between the German and Czech parties,
served to bring anti-Semitism into the field of practical politics.
Since 1867 the German Liberals had been in power. They had
made enemies of the Clericals by tampering with the concordat,
and they had split up their own party by the federalist policy
adopted by Count Taaffe. The Radical secessionists in their turn
found it difficult to agree, and an ultra-national German wing
formed itself into a separate party under the leadership of Ritter
von Schonerer (b. 1842), a Radical nationalist of the most violent
type. In 1882 two anti-Semitic leagues had been founded in
Vienna, and to these the Radical nationalists now appealed for
support. The growing importance of the party led the premier,
Count Taaffe, to angle for the support of the Clericals by accepting
a portion of the Christian Socialist programme. The hostility
this excited in the liberal press, largely written by Jews, served
to bring the feudal Christian Socialists and Radical anti-Semites
together. In 1891 these strangely assorted factions became
consolidated, and during the elections of that year Prince
Liechtenstein came forward as an anti-Semitic candidate and
the acknowledged leader of the party. The elections resulted
in the return of fifteen anti-Semites to the Reichsrath, chiefly
from Vienna.</p>

<p>Although Prince Liechtenstein and the bulk of the Christian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page142" id="page142"></a>142</span>
Socialists had joined the anti-Semites with the support of the
Clerical organ, the <i>Vaterland</i>, the Clerical party as a whole still
held aloof from the Jew-baiters. The events of 1892-1895 put
an end to their hesitation. The Hungarian government, in
compliance with long-standing pledges to the liberal party,
introduced into the diet a series of ecclesiastical reform bills
providing for civil marriage, freedom of worship, and the legal
recognition of Judasim on an equality with other denominations.
These proposals, which synchronized with Ahlwardt&rsquo;s turbulent
agitation in Germany, gave a great impulse to anti-Semitism
and served to drive into its ranks a large number of Clericals.
The agitation was taken in hand by the Roman Catholic clergy,
and the pulpits resounded with denunciations of the Jews.
One clergyman, Father Deckert, was prosecuted for preaching
the Blood Accusation and convicted (1894). Cardinal Schlauch,
bishop of Grosswardein, declared in the Hungarian House of
Magnates that the Liberals were in league with &ldquo;cosmopolitans&rdquo;
for the ruin of the country. In October 1894 the magnates
adopted two of the ecclesiastical bills with amendments, but
threw out the Jewish bill by a majority of six. The crown sided
with the magnates, and the ministry resigned, although it had
a majority in the Lower House. An effort was made to form a
Clerical cabinet, but it failed. Baron Banffy was then entrusted
with the construction of a fresh Liberal ministry. The announcement
that he would persist with the ecclesiastical bills lashed
the Clericals and anti-Semites into a fury, and the agitation
broke out afresh. The pope addressed a letter to Count Zichy
encouraging the magnates to resist, and once more two of the
bills were amended, and the third rejected. The papal nuncio,
Mgr. Agliardi, now thought proper to pay a visit to Budapest,
where he allowed himself to be interviewed on the crisis. This
interference in the domestic concerns of Hungary was deeply
resented by the Liberals, and Baron Banffy requested Count
Kalnoky, the imperial minister of foreign affairs, to protest
against it at the Vatican. Count Kalnoky refused and tendered
his resignation to the emperor. Clerical sympathies were predominant
in Vienna, and the emperor was induced for a moment
to decline the count&rsquo;s resignation. It soon became clear, however,
that the Hungarians were resolved to see the crisis out,
and that in the end Vienna would be compelled to give way.
The emperor accordingly retraced his steps, Count Kalnoky&rsquo;s
resignation was accepted, the papal nuncio was recalled, a batch
of new magnates were created, and the Hungarian ecclesiastical
bills passed.</p>

<p>Simultaneously with this crisis another startling phase of the
anti-Semitic drama was being enacted in Vienna itself. Encouraged
by the support of the Clericals the anti-Semites resolved
to make an effort to carry the Vienna municipal elections. So
far the alliance of the Clericals with the anti-Semites had been
unofficial, but on the eve of the elections (January 1895) the pope,
influenced partly by the Hungarian crisis and partly by an idea of
Cardinal Rampolla that the best antidote to democratic socialism
would be a clerically controlled fusion of the Christian Socialists
and anti-Semites, sent his blessing to Prince Liechtenstein and
his followers. This action alarmed the government and a considerable
body of the higher episcopate, who felt assured that
any permanent encouragement given to the anti-Semites would
in the end strengthen the parties of sedition and disorder.
Cardinal Schönborn was despatched in haste to Rome to expostulate
with the pontiff, and his representations were strongly
supported by the French and Belgian bishops. The mischief was
however, done, and although the pope sent a verbal message
to Prince Liechtenstein excluding the anti-Semites from his
blessing, the elections resulted in a great triumph for the
Jew-haters. The municipal council was immediately dissolved by
the government, and new elections were ordered, but these only
strengthened the position of the anti-Semites, who carried 92
seats out of a total of 138. A cabinet crisis followed, and the
premiership was entrusted to the Statthalter of Galicia, Count
Badeni, who assumed office with a pledge of war to the knife
against anti-Semitism. In October the new municipal council
elected as burgomaster of Vienna Dr Karl Lueger (b. 1844), a
vehement anti-Semite, who had displaced Prince Liechtenstein
as leader of the party. The emperor declined to sanction the
election, but the council repeated it in face of the imperial
displeasure. Once more a dissolution was ordered, and for three
months the city was governed by administrative commissioners.
In February 1896 elections were again held, and the anti-Semites
were returned with an increased majority. The emperor then
capitulated, and after a temporary arrangement, by which
for one year Dr Lueger acted as vice-burgomaster and handed
over the burgomastership to an inoffensive nominee, permitted
the municipal council to have its way. The growing anarchy in
parliament at this moment served still further to strengthen the
anti-Semites, and their conquest of Vienna was speedily followed
by a not less striking conquest of the Landtag of Lower Austria
(November 1896).</p>

<p>Since then a reaction of sanity has slowly but surely asserted
itself. In 1908 the anti-Semites had governed Vienna twelve
years, and, although they had accomplished much mischief,
the millennium of which they were supposed to be the heralds
had not dawned. On the contrary, the commercial interests
of the city had suffered and the rates had been enormously
increased (<i>Neue Freie Presse</i>, 29th March 1901),
while the predatory hopes which secured them office had only been realized
on a small and select scale. The spectacle of a Clerico-anti-Semitic
tammany in Vienna had strengthened the resistance of
the better elements in the country. Time had also shown that
Christian Socialism is only a disguise for high Toryism, and
that the German Radicals who were originally induced to join
the anti-Semites had been victimized by the Clericals. The
fruits of this disillusion began to show themselves in the general
elections of 1900-1901, when the anti-Semites lost six seats in
the Reichsrath. The elections were followed (26th January 1901)
by a papal encyclical on Christian democracy, in which Christian
Socialism was declared to be a term unacceptable to the Church,
and the faithful were adjured to abstain from agitation of a
demagogic and revolutionary character, and &ldquo;to respect the
rights of others.&rdquo; Nevertheless, in 1907 the Christian Socialists
trebled their representation in the Reichsrath. This, however,
was due more to their alliance with the German national parties
than to any large increase of anti-Semitism in the electorate.</p>

<p>The last country in Europe to make use of the teachings of
German anti-Semitism in its party politics was France. The
fact that the movement should have struck root in a
republican country, where the ideals of democratic
<span class="sidenote">France.</span>
freedom have been so passionately cultivated, has been regarded
as one of the paradoxes of our latter-day history. As a matter
of fact, it is more surprising that it was not adopted earlier. All
the social and political conditions which produced anti-Semitism
in Germany were present in France, but in an aggravated form
due primarily to the very republican <i>régime</i> which at first sight
seemed to be a guarantee against it. In the monarchical states
the dominance of the <i>bourgeoisie</i> was tempered in a measure by
the power of the crown and the political activity of the aristocracy,
which carried with them a very real restraining influence
in the matter of political honour and morality. In France these
restraining influences were driven out of public life by the republic.
The nobility both of the <i>ancien régime</i> and the empire
stood aloof, and politics were abandoned for the most part to
professional adventurers, while the <i>bourgeoisie</i> assumed the form
of an omnipotent plutocracy. This naturally attracted to France
all the financial adventurers in Europe, and in the train of the
immigration came not a few German Jews, alienated from their
own country by the agitation of Marr and Stöcker. Thus
the <i>bourgeoisie</i> was not only more powerful in France than in
other countries, but the obnoxiousness of its Jewish element
was accentuated by a tinge of the national enemy. The anti-clericalism
of the <i>bourgeois</i> republic and its unexampled series
of financial scandals, culminating in the Panama &ldquo;Krach,&rdquo; thus
sufficed to give anti-Semitism a strong hold on the public mind.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it was not until 1882 that the anti-Jewish movement
was seriously heard of in France. Paul Bontoux (b. 1820),
who had formerly been in the employ of the Rothschilds,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page143" id="page143"></a>143</span>
but had been obliged to leave the firm in consequence of
his disastrous speculations, had joined the Legitimist party,
and had started the Union Générale with funds obtained from
his new allies. Bontoux promised to break up the alleged
financial monopoly of the Jews and Protestants and to found a
new plutocracy in its stead, which should be mainly Roman
Catholic and aristocratic. The bait was eagerly swallowed.
For five years the Union Générale, with the blessing of the pope,
pursued an apparently prosperous career. Immense schemes
were undertaken, and the 123-fr. shares rose gradually to 3200
francs. The whole structure, however, rested on a basis of
audacious speculation, and in January 1882 the Union Générale
failed, with liabilities amounting to 312,000,000 francs. The cry
was at once raised that the collapse was due to the manoeuvres
of the Jews, and a strong anti-Semitic feeling manifested itself
in clerical and aristocratic circles. In 1886 violent expression
was given to this feeling in a book since become famous, <i>La
France juive</i>, by Edouard Drumont (b. 1844). The author
illustrated the theories of German anti-Semitism with a <i>chronique
scandaleuse</i> full of piquant personalities, in which the corruption
of French national life under Jewish influences was painted
in alarming colours. The book was read with avidity by the
public, who welcomed its explanations of the obviously growing
debauchery. The Wilson scandals and the suspension of the
Panama Company in the following year, while not bearing out
Drumont&rsquo;s anti-Semitism, fully justified his view of the prevailing
corruption. Out of this condition of things rose the Boulangist
movement, which rallied all the disaffected elements in the
country, including Drumont&rsquo;s following of anti-Semites. It was
not, however, until the flight of General Boulanger and the ruin of
his party that anti-Semitism came forward as a political movement.</p>

<p>The chief author of the rout of Boulangism was a Jewish
politician and journalist, Joseph Reinach (b. 1856), formerly
private secretary to Gambetta, and one of the ablest men in
France. He was a Frenchman by birth and education, but his
father and uncles were Germans, who had founded an important
banking establishment in Paris. Hence he was held to personify
the alien Jewish domination in France, and the ex-Boulangists
turned against him and his co-religionists with fury. The
Boulangist agitation had for a second time involved the Legitimists
in heavy pecuniary losses, and under the leadership of the
marquis de Morès they now threw all their influence on the side
of Drumont. An anti-Semitic league was established, and with
Royalist assistance branches were organized all over the country.
The Franco-Russian alliance in 1891, when the persecutions of
the Jews by Pobêdonostsev were attracting the attention of
Europe, served to invest Drumont&rsquo;s agitation with a fashionable
and patriotic character. It was a sign of the spiritual approximation
of the two peoples. In 1892 Drumont founded a daily
anti-Semitic newspaper, <i>La Libre Parole</i>. With the organization
of this journal a regular campaign for the discovery of scandals
was instituted. At the same time a body of aristocratic swashbucklers,
with the marquis de Morès and the comte de Lamase
at their head, set themselves to terrorize the Jews and provoke
them to duels. At a meeting held at Neuilly in 1891, Jules
Guérin, one of the marquis de Morès&rsquo;s lieutenants, had demanded
rhetorically <i>un cadavre de Juif</i>. He had not long to wait. Anti-Semitism
was most powerful in the army, which was the only
branch of the public service in which the reactionary classes were
fully represented. The republican law compelling the seminarists
to serve their term in the army had strengthened its Clerical and
Royalist elements, and the result was a movement against the
Jewish officers, of whom 500 held commissions. A series of
articles in the <i>Libre Parole</i> attacking these officers led to a number
of ferocious duels, and these culminated in 1892 in the death of an
amiable and popular Jewish officer, Captain Armand Mayer, of
the Engineers, who fell, pierced through the lungs by the marquis
de Morès. This tragedy, rendered all the more painful by the
discovery that Captain Mayer had chivalrously fought to shield
a friend, aroused a great deal of popular indignation against the
anti-Semites, and for a moment it was believed that the agitation
had been killed with its victim.</p>

<p>Towards the end of 1892, the discovery of the widespread
corruption practised by the Panama Company gave a fresh
impulse to anti-Semitism. The revelations were in a large
measure due to the industry of the <i>Libre Parole</i>; and they were
all the more welcome to the readers of that journal since it was
discovered that three Jews were implicated in the scandals, one
of whom, baron de Reinach, was uncle and father-in-law to the
hated destroyer of Boulangism. The escape of the other two, Dr
Cornelius Herz and M. Arton, and the difficulties experienced in
obtaining their extradition, deepened the popular conviction that
the authorities were implicated in the scandals, and kept the
public eye for a long time absorbed by the otherwise restricted
Jewish aspects of the scandals. In 1894 the military side of the
agitation was revived by the arrest of a prominent Jewish staff
officer, Captain Alfred Dreyfus, on a charge of treason. From
the beginning the hand of the anti-Semite was flagrant in the new
sensation. The first hint of the arrest appeared in the <i>Libre
Parole</i>; and before the facts had been officially communicated
to the public that journal was busy with a campaign against the
war minister, based on the apprehension that, in conspiracy with
the <i>Juiverie</i> and his republican colleagues, he might exert himself
to shield the traitor. Anti-Semitic feeling was now thoroughly
aroused. Panama had prepared the people to believe anything;
and when it was announced that a court-martial, sitting in secret,
had convicted Dreyfus, there was a howl of execration against
the Jews from one end of the country to the other, although
the alleged crime of the convict and the evidence by which
it was supported were quite unknown. Dreyfus was degraded
and transported for life amid unparalleled scenes of public
excitement.</p>

<p>The Dreyfus Case registers the climax not only of French, but
of European anti-Semitism. It was the most ambitious and
most unscrupulous attempt yet made to prove the nationalist
hypothesis of the anti-Semites, and in its failure it afforded the
most striking illustration of the dangers of the whole movement
by bringing France to the verge of revolution. For a few months
after the Dreyfus court-martial there was a comparative lull;
but the highly strung condition of popular passion was illustrated
by a violent debate on &ldquo;The Jewish Peril&rdquo; in the Chamber of
Deputies (25th April 1895), and by two outrages with explosives
at the Rothschild bank in Paris. Meanwhile the family of
Dreyfus, absolutely convinced of his innocence, were casting
about for the means of clearing his character and securing his
liberation. They were wealthy, and their activity unsettled the
public mind and aroused the apprehensions of the conspirators.
Had the latter known how to preserve silence, the mystery would
perhaps have been yet unsolved; but in their anxiety to allay
all suspicions they made one false step, which proved the beginning
of their ruin. Through their friends in the press they secured
the publication of a facsimile of a document known as the
<i>Bordereau</i>&mdash;a list of documents supposed to be in Dreyfus&rsquo;s
handwriting and addressed apparently to the military attaché of
a foreign power, which was alleged to constitute the chief evidence
against the convict. It was hoped by this publication to put an
end to the doubts of the so-called Dreyfusards. The result, however,
was only to give them a clue on which they worked with
remarkable ingenuity. To prove that the <i>Bordereau</i> was not in
Dreyfus&rsquo;s handwriting was not difficult. Indeed, its authorship
was recognized almost on the day of publication; but the
Dreyfusards held their hands in order to make assurance doubly
sure by further evidence. Meanwhile one of the officers of the
general staff, Colonel Picquart, had convinced himself by an
examination of the <i>dossier</i> of the trial that a gross miscarriage
of justice had taken place. On mentioning his doubts to his
superiors, who were animated partly by anti-Semitic feeling and
partly by reluctance to confess to a mistake, he was ordered to
the Tunisian hinterland on a dangerous expedition. Before
leaving Paris, however, he took the precaution to confide his
discovery to his legal adviser. Harassed by their anxieties, the
conspirators made further communications to the newspapers;
and the government, questioned and badgered in parliament,
added to the revelations. The new disclosures, so far from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>144</span>
stopping the Dreyfusards, proved to them, among other things, that
the conviction had been partially based on documents which had
not been communicated to the counsel for the defence, and hence
that the judges had been tampered with by the ministry of war
behind the prisoner&rsquo;s back. So far, too, as these documents
related to correspondence with foreign military attachés, it was
soon ascertained that they were forgeries. In this way a terrible
indictment was gradually drawn up against the ministry of war.
The first step was taken towards the end of 1897 by a brother
of Captain Dreyfus, who, in a letter to the minister of war, denounced
Major Esterhazy as the real author of the <i>Bordereau</i>.
The authorities, supported by parliament, declined to reopen the
Dreyfus Case, but they ordered a court-martial on Esterhazy,
which was held with closed doors and resulted in his acquittal.
It now became clear that nothing short of an appeal to public
opinion and a full exposure of all the iniquities that had been
perpetrated would secure justice at the hands of the military
chiefs. On behalf of Dreyfus, Émile Zola, the eminent novelist,
formulated the case against the general staff of the army in an
open letter to the president of the republic, which by its dramatic
accusations startled the whole world. The letter was denounced
as wild and fantastic even by those who were in favour of revision.
Zola was prosecuted for libel and convicted, and had to fly the
country; but the agitation he had started was taken in hand by
others, notably M. Clémenceau, M. Reinach and M. Yves Guyot.
In August 1898 their efforts found their first reward. A re-examination
of the documents in the case by M. Cavaignac, then
minister of war, showed that one was undoubtedly forged.
Colonel Henry, of the intelligence department of the war office,
then confessed that he had fabricated the document, and, on
being sent to Mont Valérien under arrest, cut his throat.</p>

<p>In spite of this damaging discovery the war office still persisted
in believing Dreyfus guilty, and opposed a fresh inquiry.
It was supported by three successive ministers of war, and apparently
an overwhelming body of public opinion. By this time
the question of the guilt or innocence of Dreyfus had become an
altogether subsidiary issue. As in Germany and Austria, the
anti-Semitic crusade had passed into the hands of the political
parties. On the one hand the Radicals and Socialists, recognizing
the anti-republican aims of the agitators and alarmed by the
clerical predominance in the army, had thrown in their lot with
the Dreyfusards; on the other the reactionaries, anxious to
secure the support of the army, took the opposite view, denounced
their opponents as <i>sans patrie</i>, and declared that they were
conspiring to weaken and degrade the army in the face of the
national enemy. The controversy was, consequently, no longer
for or against Dreyfus, but for or against the army, and behind it
was a life-or-death struggle between the republic and its enemies.
The situation became alarming. Rumours of military plots
filled the air. Powerful leagues for working up public feeling
were formed and organized; attempts to discredit the republic
and intimidate the government were made. The president was
insulted; there were tumults in the streets, and an attempt was
made by M. Déroulède to induce the military to march on the
Elysée and upset the republic. In this critical situation France,
to her eternal honour, found men with sufficient courage to do
the right. The Socialists, by rallying to the Radicals against the
reactionaries, secured a majority for the defence of the republic
in parliament. Brisson&rsquo;s cabinet transmitted to the court of
cassation an application for the revision of the case against
Dreyfus; and that tribunal, after an elaborate inquiry, which
fully justified Zola&rsquo;s famous letter, quashed and annulled the
proceedings of the court-martial, and remitted the accused to
another court-martial, to be held at Rennes. Throughout these
proceedings the military party fought tooth and nail to impede
the course of justice; and although the innocence of Dreyfus had
been completely established, it concentrated all its efforts to
secure a fresh condemnation of the prisoner at Rennes. Popular
passion was at fever heat, and it manifested itself in an attack on
M. Labori, one of the counsel for the defence, who was shot and
wounded on the eve of his cross-examination of the witnesses for
the prosecution. To the amazement and indignation of the
whole world outside France, the Rennes court-martial again
found the prisoner guilty; but all reliance on the conscientiousness
of the verdict was removed by a rider, which found &ldquo;extenuating
circumstances,&rdquo; and by a reduction of the punishment
to ten years&rsquo; imprisonment, to which was added a recommendation
to mercy. The verdict was evidently an attempt at a compromise,
and the government resolved to advise the president
of the republic to pardon Dreyfus. This lame conclusion did
not satisfy the accused; but his innocence had been so clearly
proved, and on political grounds there were such urgent reasons
for desiring a termination of the affair, that it was accepted
without protest by the majority of moderate men.</p>

<p>The rehabilitation of Dreyfus, however, did not pass without
another effort on the part of the reactionaries to turn the popular
passions excited by the case to their own advantage. After the
failure of Déroulède&rsquo;s attempt to overturn the republic, the
various Royalist and Boulangist leagues, with the assistance of
the anti-Semites, organized another plot. This was discovered
by the government, and the leaders were arrested. Jules Guérin,
secretary of the anti-Semitic league, shut himself up in the league
offices in the rue Chabrol, Paris, which had been fortified and
garrisoned by a number of his friends, armed with rifles. For
more than a month these anti-Semites held the authorities at bay,
and some 5000 troops were employed in the siege. The conspirators
were all tried by the senate, sitting as a high court, and
Guérin was sentenced to ten years&rsquo; imprisonment. The evidence
showed that the anti-Semitic organization had taken an active
part in the anti-republican plot (see the report of the Commission
d&rsquo;Instruction in the <i>Petit Temps</i>, 1st November 1899).</p>

<p>The government now resolved to strike at the root of the
mischief by limiting the power of the religious orders, and with
this view a drastic Association bill was introduced into the
chambers. This anti-clerical move provoked the wildest
passions of the reactionaries, but it found an overwhelming
support in the elections of 1902 and the bill became law. The
war thus definitely reopened soon led to a revival of the Dreyfus
controversy. The nationalists flooded the country with incendiary
defamations of &ldquo;the government of national treason,&rdquo; and
Dreyfus on his part loudly demanded a fresh trial. It was clear
that conciliation and compromise were useless. Early in 1905
M. Jaurès urged upon the chamber that the demand of the
Jewish officer should be granted if only to tranquillize the country.
The necessary <i>faits nouveaux</i> were speedily found by the minister
of war, General André, and having been examined by a special
commission of revision were ordered to be transmitted to the
court of cassation for final adjudication. On the 12th of July
1906, the court, all chambers united, gave its judgment. After
a lengthy review of the case it declared unanimously that the
whole accusation against Dreyfus had been disproved, and it
quashed the judgment of the Rennes court-martial <i>sans renvoi</i>.
The explanation of the whole case is that Esterhazy and Henry
were the real culprits; that they had made a trade of supplying
the German government with military documents; and that once
the <i>Bordereau</i> was discovered they availed themselves of the
anti-Jewish agitation to throw suspicion on Dreyfus.</p>

<p>Thus ended this famous case, to the relief of the whole country
and with the approval of the great majority of French citizens.
Except a knot of anti-Semitic monomaniacs all parties bowed
loyally to the judgment of the court of cassation. The
government gave the fullest effect to the judgment. Dreyfus and
Picquart were restored to the active list of the army with the
ranks respectively of major and general of brigade. Dreyfus was
also created a knight of the Legion of Honour, and received the
decoration in public in the artillery pavilion of the military school.
Zola, to whose efforts the triumph of truth was chiefly due, had
not been spared to witness the final scene, but the chambers
decided to give his remains a last resting-place in the Pantheon.
When three months later M. Clémenceau formed his first cabinet
he appointed General Picquart minister of war. Nothing indeed
was left undone to repair the terrible series of wrongs which had
grown out of the Dreyfus case. Nevertheless its destructive
work could not be wholly healed. For over ten years it had been
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>145</span>
a nightmare to France, and it now modified the whole course of
French history. In the ruin of the French Church, which owed
its disestablishment very largely to the Dreyfus conspiracy, may
be read the most eloquent warning against the demoralizing
madness of anti-Semitism.</p>

<p>In sympathy with the agitation in France there has been a
similar movement in Algeria, where the European population
have long resented the admission of the native Jews to the rights
of French citizenship. The agitation has been marked by much
violence, and most of the anti-Semitic deputies in the French
parliament, including M. Drumont, have found constituencies in
Algeria. As the local anti-Semites are largely Spaniards and
Levantine riff-raff, the agitation has not the peculiar nationalist
bias which characterizes continental anti-Semitism. Before the
energy of the authorities it has lately shown signs of subsiding.</p>

<p>While the main activity of anti-Semitism has manifested itself
in Germany, Russia, Rumania, Austria-Hungary and France, its
vibratory influences have been felt in other countries
when conditions favourable to its extension have
<span class="sidenote">Great Britain, &amp;c.</span>
presented themselves. In England more than one
attempt to acclimatize the doctrines of Marr and
Treitschke has been made. The circumstance that at the time of
the rise of German anti-Semitism a premier of Hebrew race, Lord
Beaconsfield, was in power first suggested the Jewish bogey to
English political extremists. The Eastern crisis of 1876-1878,
which was regarded by the Liberal party as primarily a struggle
between Christianity, as represented by Russia, and a degrading
Semitism, as represented by Turkey, accentuated the anti-Jewish
feeling, owing to the anti-Russian attitude adopted by
the government. Violent expression to the ancient prejudices
against the Jews was given by Sir J.G. Tollemache Sinclair
(<i>A Defence of Russia</i>, 1877). Mr T.P. O&rsquo;Connor, in a life of Lord
Beaconsfield (1878), pictured him as the instrument of the Jewish
people, &ldquo;moulding the whole policy of Christendom to Jewish
aims.&rdquo; Professor Goldwin Smith, in several articles in the
<i>Nineteenth Century</i> (1878, 1881 and 1882), sought to synthetize
the growing anti-Jewish feeling by adopting the nationalist
theories of the German anti-Semites. This movement did not
fail to find an equivocal response in the speeches of some of the
leading Liberal statesmen; but on the country generally it produced
no effect. It was revived when the persecutions in Russia
threatened England with a great influx of Polish Jews, whose
mode of life was calculated to lower the standard of living in
the industries in which they were employed, and it has left its
trace in the anti-alien legislation of 1905. In 1883 Stöcker
visited London, but received a very unflattering reception.
Abortive attempts to acclimatize anti-Semitism have also been
made in Switzerland, Belgium, Greece and the United States.</p>

<p>Anti-Semitism made a great deal of history during the thirty
years up to 1908, but has left no permanent mark of a constructive
kind on the social and political evolution of Europe.
It is the fruit of a great ethnographic and political error, and it
has spent itself in political intrigues of transparent dishonesty.
Its racial doctrine is at best a crude hypothesis: its nationalist
theory has only served to throw into striking relief the essentially
economic bases of modern society, while its political activity
has revealed the vulgarity and ignorance which constitute its
main sources of strength. So far from injuring the Jews, it has
really given Jewish racial separatism a new lease of life. Its
extravagant accusations, as in the Tisza Eszlar and Dreyfus
cases, have resulted in the vindication of the Jewish character.
Its agitation generally, coinciding with the revival of interest in
Jewish history, has helped to transfer Jewish solidarity from a
religious to a racial basis. The bond of a common race, vitalized
by a new pride in Hebrew history and spurred on to resistance by
the insults of the anti-Semites, has given a new spirit and a new
source of strength to Judaism at a moment when the approximation
of ethical systems and the revolt against dogma were sapping
its essentially religious foundations. In the whole history of
Judaism, perhaps, there have been no more numerous or remarkable
instances of reversions to the faith than in the period
in question. The reply of the Jews to anti-Semitism has taken
two interesting practical forms. In the first place there is the
so-called Zionist movement, which is a kind of Jewish nationalism
and is vitiated by the same errors that distinguish its anti-Semitic
analogue (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Zionism</a></span>). In the second place, there is a
movement represented by the Maccabaeans&rsquo; Society in London,
which seeks to unite the Jewish people in an effort to raise the
Jewish character and to promote a higher consciousness of the
dignity of the race. It lays no stress on orthodoxy, but welcomes
all who strive to render Jewish conduct an adequate reply to
the theories of the anti-Semites. Both these movements are
elements of fresh vitality to Judaism, and they are probably
destined to produce important fruit in future years. A
splendid spirit of generosity has also been displayed by the Jewish
community in assisting and relieving the victims of the Jew-haters.
Besides countless funds raised by public subscription,
Baron de Hirsch founded a colossal scheme for transplanting
persecuted Jews to new countries under new conditions of life,
and endowed it with no less a sum than £9,000,000 (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hirsch,
Maurice de</a></span>).</p>

<p>Though anti-Semitism has been unmasked and discredited,
it is to be feared that its history is not yet at an end. While
there remain in Russia and Rumania over six millions of Jews who
are being systematically degraded, and who periodically overflow
the western frontier, there must continue to be a Jewish question
in Europe; and while there are weak governments, and ignorant
and superstitious elements in the enfranchized classes of the
countries affected, that question will seek to play a part in politics.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p><span class="sc">Literature</span>.&mdash;No impartial history of modern anti-Semitism has
yet been written. The most comprehensive works on the subject,
<i>Israel among the Nations</i>, by A. Leroy-Beaulieu (1895), and <i>L&rsquo;Antisémitisme,
son histoire et ses causes</i>, by Bernard Lazare (1894), are
collections of studies rather than histories. M. Lazare&rsquo;s work will
be found most useful by the student on account of its detached
standpoint and its valuable bibliographical notes. A good list of
works relating to Jewish ethnography will be found at the end of
M. Isidor Loeb&rsquo;s valuable article, &ldquo;Juifs,&rdquo; in the <i>Dictionnaire
universel de géographie</i> (1884). To these should be added, Adolf
Jellinek, <i>Der Jüdische Stamm</i> (1869); Chwolson, <i>Die semitischen
Volker</i> (1872); Nossig, <i>Materialien zur Statistik</i> (1887); Jacobs,
<i>Jewish Statistics</i> (1891); and Andree, <i>Zur Volkskunde der Juden</i>
(1881). A bibliography of the Jewish question from 1875 to 1884
has been published by Mr Joseph Jacobs (1885). Useful additions
and rectifications will be found in the <i>Jewish World</i>, 11th September
1885. During the period since 1885 the anti-Semitic movement
has produced an immense pamphlet literature. Some of these productions
have already been referred to; others will be found in
current bibliographies under the names of the personages mentioned,
such as Stöcker, Ahlwardt, &amp;c. On the Russian persecutions,
besides the works quoted by Jacobs, see the pamphlet issued by the
Russo-Jewish Committee in 1890, and the annual reports of the
Russo-Jewish Mansion House Fund; <i>Les Juifs de Russie</i> (Paris,
1891); <i>Report of the Commissioners of Immigration upon the Causes
which incite Immigration to the United States</i> (Washington, 1892);
<i>The New Exodus</i>, by Harold Frederic (1892); <i>Les Juifs  russes</i>, by
Leo Errera (Brussels, 1893). The most valuable collection of facts
relating to the persecutions of 1881-1882 are to be found in the
<i>Feuilles Jaunes</i> (52 nos.), compiled and circulated for the information
of the European press by the Alliance Israélite of Paris. Complete
collections are very scarce. For the struggle during the past decade
the <i>Russische Correspondenz</i> of Berlin should be consulted, together
with its French and English editions. See also the publications of
the <i>Bund</i> (Geneva; Imprimerie Israélite); Séménoff, <i>The Russian
Government and the Massacres</i>, and <i>Quarterly Review</i>, October 1906.
On the Rumanian question, see Bluntschli, <i>Roumania and the Legal
Status of the Jews</i> (London, 1879); <i>Wir Juden</i> (Zürich, 1883);

Persecuting Power,&rdquo; <i>Nat. Rev</i>., February 1901. On Hungary and
the Tisza Eszlar Case, see (besides the references in Jacobs) Nathan,
<i>Der Prozess van Tisza Eszlar</i> (Berlin, 1892). On this case and the
Blood Accusation generally, see Wright, &ldquo;The Jews and the Malicious
Charge of Human Sacrifice,&rdquo; <i>Nineteenth Century</i>, 1883. The
origins of the Austrian agitation are dealt with by Nitti, <i>Catholic
Socialism</i> (1895). This work, though inclining to anti-Semitism,
should be consulted for the Christian Socialist elements in the whole
continental agitation. The most valuable source of information on
the Austrian movement is the <i>Österreichische Wochenschrift</i>, edited
by Dr Bloch. See also pamphlets and speeches by the anti-Semitic
leaders, Liechtenstein, Lueger, Schoenerer, &amp;c. The case of the
French anti-Semites is stated by E. Drumont in his <i>France juive</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>146</span>
and other works; the other side by Isidor Loeb, Bernard Lazare, Leonce
Reynaud, &amp;c. Of the Dreyfus Case there is an enormous literature: see
especially the reports of the Zola and Picquart trials, the revision
case before the Court of Cassation, the proceedings of the Rennes
court-martial, and the final judgment of the Court of Cassation printed
in full in the <i>Figaro</i>, July 15, 1906; also Reinach, <i>Histoire de
l&rsquo;affaire Dreyfus</i> (Paris, 1908, 6 vols.), and the valuable series of
volumes by Captain Paul Marin, MM. Clémenceau, Lazare, Yves Guyot,
Paschal Grousset, Urbain Gohier, de Haime, de Pressensé, and the
remarkable letters of Dreyfus (<i>Lettres d&rsquo;un innocent</i>). An English
history of the case was published by F.C. Conybeare (1898), whose
articles and those of Sir Godfrey Lushington and L.J. Maxse in the
<i>National Review</i>, 1897-1900, will be found invaluable by the student.
On the Algerian question, see M. Wahl in the <i>Revue des études juives</i>;
L. Forest, <i>Naturalisation des Israélites algériens</i>; and E. Audinet in
the <i>Revue générale de droit international publique</i>, 1897, No. 4. On
the history of the anti-Semitic movement generally, see the annual
reports of the Alliance Israélite of Paris and the Anglo-Jewish
Association of London, also the annual summaries published at the end of
the Jewish year by the <i>Jewish Chronicle</i> of London. The connexion of
the movement with general party politics must be followed in the
newspapers. The present writer has worked with a collection of newspaper
cuttings numbering several thousands and ranging over thirty years.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTISEPTICS<a name="ar150" id="ar150"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="anti">&#7936;&#957;&#964;&#8054;</span>, against, and <span class="grk" title="sêptikos">&#963;&#951;&#960;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#962;</span>,
putrefactive), the name given to substances which are used for the
prevention of bacterial development in animal or vegetable matter. Some
are true germicides, capable of destroying the bacteria, whilst others
merely prevent or inhibit their growth. The antiseptic method of
treating wounds (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Surgery</a></span>) was introduced by Lord Lister, and was an
outcome of Pasteur&rsquo;s germ theory of putrefaction. For the growth of
bacteria there must be a certain food supply, moisture, in most cases
oxygen, and a certain minimum temperature (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Bacteriology</a></span>). These
conditions have been specially studied and applied in connexion with the
preserving of food (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Food Preservation</a></span>) and in the ancient practice
of embalming the dead, which is the earliest illustration of the
systematic use of antiseptics (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Embalming</a></span>). In early inquiries a
great point was made of the prevention of putrefaction, and work was
done in the way of finding how much of an agent must be added to a given
solution, in order that the bacteria accidentally present might not
develop. But for various reasons this was an inexact method, and to-day
an antiseptic is judged by its effects on pure cultures of definite
pathogenic microbes, and on their vegetative and spore forms. Their
standardization has been effected in many instances, and a water
solution of carbolic acid of a certain fixed strength is now taken as
the standard with which other antiseptics are compared. The more
important of those in use to-day are carbolic acid, the perchloride and
biniodide of mercury, iodoform, formalin, salicylic acid, &amp;c. Carbolic
acid is germicidal in strong solution, inhibitory in weaker ones. The
so-called &ldquo;pure&rdquo; acid is applied to infected living tissues, especially
to tuberculous sinuses or wounds, after scraping them, in order to
destroy any part of the tuberculous material still remaining. A solution
of 1 in 20 is used to sterilize instruments before an operation, and
towels or lint to be used for the patient. Care must always be taken to
avoid absorption (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Carbolic Acid</a></span>). The perchloride of mercury is
another very powerful antiseptic used in solutions of strength 1 in
2000, 1 in 1000 and 1 in 500. This or the biniodide of mercury is the
last antiseptic applied to the surgeon&rsquo;s and assistants&rsquo; hands before an
operation begins. They are not, however, to be used in the disinfection
of instruments, nor where any large abraded surface would favour
absorption. Boracic acid receives no mention here; though it is
popularly known as an antiseptic, it is in reality only a soothing
fluid, and bacteria will flourish comfortably in contact with it. Of the
dry antiseptics iodoform is constantly used in septic or tuberculous
wounds, and it appears to have an inhibitory action on <i>Bacillus
tuberculosis</i>. Its power depends on the fact that it is slowly
decomposed by the tissues, and free iodine given off. Among the more
recently introduced antiseptics, chinosol, a yellow substance freely
soluble in water, and lysol, another coal-tar derivative, are much used.
But every antiseptic, however good, is more or less toxic and irritating
to a wounded surface. Hence it is that the &ldquo;antiseptic&rdquo; method has been
replaced in the surgery of to-day by the &ldquo;aseptic&rdquo; method (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Surgery</a></span>),
which relies on keeping free from the invasion of bacteria rather than
destroying them when present.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTISTHENES<a name="ar151" id="ar151"></a></span> (<i>c.</i> 444-365 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), the founder of the Cynic school of
philosophy, was born at Athens of a Thracian mother, a fact which may
account for the extreme boldness of his attack on conventional thought.
In his youth he studied rhetoric under Gorgias, perhaps also under
Hippias and Prodicus. Gomperz suggests that he was originally in good
circumstances, but was reduced to poverty. However this may be, he came
under the influence of Socrates, and became a devoted pupil. So eager
was he to hear the words of Socrates that he used to walk daily from
Peiraeus to Athens, and persuaded his friends to accompany him. Filled
with enthusiasm for the Socratic idea of virtue, he founded a school of
his own in the Cynosarges, the hall of the bastards (<span class="grk" title="nothoi">&#957;&#972;&#952;&#959;&#953;</span>).
Thither he attracted the poorer classes by the simplicity of his life
and teaching. He wore a cloak and carried a staff and a wallet, and this
costume became the uniform of his followers. Diogenes Laertius says that
his works filled ten volumes, but of these fragments only remain. His
favourite style seems to have been the dialogue, wherein we see the
effect of his early rhetorical training. Aristotle speaks of him as
uneducated and simple-minded, and Plato describes him as struggling in
vain with the difficulties of dialectic. His work represents one great
aspect of Socratic philosophy, and should be compared with the Cyrenaic
and Megarian doctrines.</p>

returning movement from west to east, in response to the strophe, which
was sung from east to west. It is of the nature of a reply, and balances
the effect of the strophe. Thus, in Gray&rsquo;s ode called &ldquo;The Progress of
Poesy,&rdquo; the strophe, which dwelt in triumphant accents on the beauty,
power and ecstasy of verse, is answered by the antistrophe, in a
depressed and melancholy key&mdash;</p>

<p class="noind">When the sections of the chorus have ended their responses, they unite

were a kind of stanza framed only for the music then used with the

<p><span class="bold">ANTITHESIS<a name="ar153" id="ar153"></a></span> (the Greek for &ldquo;setting opposite&rdquo;), in rhetoric, the bringing
out of a contrast in the meaning by an obvious contrast in the
expression, as in the following:&mdash;&ldquo;When there is need of silence, you
speak, and when there is need of speech, you are dumb; when present, you
wish to be absent, and when absent, you desire to be present; in peace
you are for war, and in war you long for peace; in council you descant
on bravery, and in the battle you tremble.&rdquo; Antithesis is sometimes
double or alternate, as in the appeal of Augustus:&mdash;&ldquo;Listen, young men,
to an old man to whom old men were glad to listen when he was young.&rdquo;
The force of the antithesis is increased if the words on which the beat
of the contrast falls are alliterative, or otherwise similar in sound,
as&mdash;&ldquo;The fairest but the falsest of her sex.&rdquo; There is nothing that
gives to expression greater point and vivacity than a judicious
employment of this figure; but, on the other hand, there is nothing more
tedious and trivial than a pseudo-antithetical style. Among English
writers who have made the most abundant use of antithesis are Pope,
Young, Johnson, and Gibbon; and especially Lyly in his <i>Euphues</i>. It is,
however, a much more common feature in French than in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>147</span>

which it corresponds as the stamp to the die, or vice versa. In
the sense of copy or likeness the word occurs in the Greek New
Testament (Heb. ix. 24; 1 Peter iii. 21), English &ldquo;figure.&rdquo; By
theological writers antitype is employed to denote the reality of
which a type is the prophetic symbol. Thus, Christ is the antitype
of many of the types of the Jewish ritual. By the fathers

<p><span class="bold">ANTIUM<a name="ar155" id="ar155"></a></span> (mod. <i>Anzio</i>), an ancient Volscian city on the coast
of Latium, about 33 m. S. of Rome. The legends as to its
foundation, and the accounts of its early relations with Rome,
are untrustworthy; but Livy&rsquo;s account of wars between Antium
and Rome, early in the 4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, may perhaps be accepted.
Antium is named with Ardea, Laurentum and Circeii,
as under Roman protection, in the treaty with Carthage in
348 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> In 341 it lost its independence after a rising with the
rest of Latium against Rome, and the beaks (<i>rostra</i>) of the six
captured Antiatine ships decorated and gave their name to the
orators&rsquo; tribunal in the Roman Forum. At the end of the
Republican period it became a resort of wealthy Romans, and
the Julian and Claudian emperors frequently visited it; both
Caligula and Nero were born there. The latter founded a colony
of veterans and built a new harbour, the projecting moles of
which are still extant. In the middle ages it was deserted in
favour of Nettuno: at the end of the 17th century Innocent XII.
and Clement XI. restored the harbour, not on the old site but
to the east of it, with the opening to the east, a mistake which
leads to its being frequently silted up; it has a depth of about
15 ft. Remains of Roman villas are conspicuous all along the
shore, both to the east and to the north-west of the town. That
of Nero cannot be certainly identified, but is generally placed at
the so-called Arco Muto, where remains of a theatre (discovered
in 1712 and covered up again) also exist. Many works of art
have been found. Of the famous temple of Fortune (Horace,
<i>Od</i>. i. 35) no remains are known. The sea is encroaching
slightly at Anzio, but some miles farther north-west the old
Roman coast-line now lies slightly inland (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Tiber</a></span>). The
Volscian city stood on higher ground and somewhat away from
the shore, though it extended down to it. It was defended by
a deep ditch, which can still be traced, and by walls, a portion
of which, on the eastern side, constructed of rectangular blocks
of tufa, was brought to light in 1897. The modern place is a
summer resort and has several villas, among them the Villa
Borghese.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTIVARI<a name="ar156" id="ar156"></a></span> (Montenegrin <i>Bar</i>, so called by the Venetians
from its position opposite Bari in Italy), a seaport of Montenegro
which until 1878 belonged to Turkey. Pop. (1900) about 2500.
The old town is built inland, on a strip of country running
between the Adriatic Sea and the Sutorman range of mountains,
overshadowed by the peak of Rumiya (5148 ft.). At a few
hundred yards&rsquo; distance it is invisible, hidden among dense
olive groves. Within, there is a ruinous walled village, and the
shell of an old Venetian fortress, surrounded by mosques and
bazaars; for Antivari is rather Turkish than Montenegrin.
The fine bay of Antivari, with Prstan, its port, is distant about
one hour&rsquo;s drive through barren and forbidding country, shut
in by mountains. At the northern horn of the bay stands
Spizza, an Austrian military station. Antivari contains the
residence of its Roman Catholic archbishop, and, in the centre
of the shore, Topolitsa, the square undecorated palace of the
crown prince. Antivari is the name applied both to Prstan and
the old town. The Austrian Lloyd steamers call at times, and
the &ldquo;Puglia&rdquo; S.S. Company runs a regular service of steamers
to and from Bari. As an outlet for Montenegrin commerce,
however, Antivari cannot compete with the Austrian
Cattaro, the harbour being somewhat difficult of access in
stormy weather. Fishing and olive-oil refining are the main
industries.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANT-LION,<a name="ar157" id="ar157"></a></span> the name given to neuropterous insects of the
family <i>Myrmeleonidae</i>, with relatively short and apically clubbed
antennae and four large densely reticulated wings in which
the apical veins enclose regular oblong spaces. The perfect
insects are for the most part nocturnal and are believed to be
carnivorous. The best-known species, <i>Myrmeleon formicarius</i>,
which may be found adult in the late summer, occurs in many
countries on the European continent, though like the rest of this
group it is not indigenous in England. Strictly speaking, however,
the term ant-lion applies to the larval form, which has been
known scientifically for over two hundred years, on account of its
peculiar and forbidding appearance and its skilful and unique
manner of entrapping prey by means of a pitfall. The abdomen
is oval, sandy-grey in hue and beset with warts and bristles;
the prothorax forms a mobile neck for the large square head,
which carries a pair of long and powerful toothed mandibles.
It is in dry and sandy soil that the ant-lion lays its trap. Having
marked out the chosen site by a circular groove, it starts to crawl
backwards, using its abdomen as a plough to shovel up the soil.
By the aid of one front leg it places consecutive heaps of loosened
particles upon its head, then with a smart jerk throws each little
pile clear of the scene of operations. Proceeding thus it gradually
works its way from the circumference towards the centre. When
the latter is reached and the pit completed, the larva settles
down at the bottom, buried in the soil with only the jaws projecting
above the surface. Since the sides of the pit consist of
loose sand they afford an insecure foothold to any small insect
that inadvertently ventures over the edge. Slipping to the
bottom the prey is immediately seized by the lurking ant-lion;
or if it attempt to scramble again up the treacherous walls of the
pit, is speedily checked in its efforts and brought down by showers
of loose sand which are jerked at it from below by the larva.
By means of similar head-jerks the skins of insects sucked dry
of their contents are thrown out of the pit, which is then kept
clear of refuse. A full-grown larva digs a pit about 2 in. deep
and 3 in. wide at the edge. The pupa stage of the ant-lion is
quiescent. The larva makes a globular case of sand stuck
together with fine silk spun, it is said, from a slender spinneret
at the posterior end of the body. In this it remains until the
completion of the transformation into the sexually mature insect,
which then emerges from the case, leaving the pupal integument
behind. In certain species of <i>Myrmeleonidae</i>, such as <i>Dendroleon
pantheormis</i>, the larva, although resembling that of <i>Myrmeleon</i>
structurally, makes no pitfall, but seizes passing prey from any
nook or crevice in which it shelters.</p>

<p>The exact meaning of the name ant-lion (Fr. <i>fourmilion</i>)
is uncertain. It has been thought that it refers to the fact
that ants form a large percentage of the prey of the insect,
the suffix &ldquo;lion&rdquo; merely suggesting destroyer or eater. Perhaps,
however, the name may only signify a large terrestrial
biting apterous insect, surpassing the ant in size and predatory
habits.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTOFAGASTA,<a name="ar158" id="ar158"></a></span> a town and port of northern Chile and

long. Pop. (est. 1902) 16,084. Antofagasta is the seaport for a
railway running to Oruro, Bolivia, and is the only available
outlet for the trade of the south-western departments of that
republic. The smelting works for the neighbouring silver mines
are located here, and a thriving trade with the inland mining
towns is carried on. The town was founded in 1870 as a shipping
port for the recently discovered silver mines of that vicinity,
and belonged to Bolivia until 1879, when it was occupied by a
Chilean military force.</p>

<p>The province of <span class="sc">Antofagasta</span> has an area of 46,611 sq. m.
lying within the desert of Atacama and between the provinces of
Tarapacá and Atacama. It is rich in saline and other mineral
deposits, the important Caracoles silver mines being about 90 m.
north-east of the port of Antofagasta. Like the other provinces
of this region, Antofagasta produces for export copper, silver,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>148</span>
silver ores, lead, nitrate of soda, borax and salt. Iron and
manganese ores are also found. Besides Antofagasta the
principal towns are Taltal, Mejillones, Cobija (the old capital)
and Tocopilla. Up to 1879 the province belonged to Bolivia,
and was known as the department of Atacama, or the Litoral.
It fell into the possession of Chile in the war of 1879-82, and was
definitely ceded to that republic in 1885.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTONELLI, GIACOMO<a name="ar160" id="ar160"></a></span> (1806-1876), Italian cardinal, was
born at Sonnino on the 2nd of April 1806. He was educated for
the priesthood, but, after taking minor orders, gave up the
idea of becoming a priest, and chose an administrative career.
Created secular prelate, he was sent as apostolic delegate to
Viterbo, where he early manifested his reactionary tendencies
in an attempt to stamp out Liberalism. Recalled to Rome in
1841, he entered the office of the papal secretary of state, but
four years later was appointed pontifical treasurer-general.
Created cardinal (11th June 1847), he was chosen by Pius IX. to
preside over the council of state entrusted with the drafting of
the constitution. On the 10th of March 1848 Antonelli became
premier of the first constitutional ministry of Pius IX., a
capacity in which he displayed consummate duplicity. Upon the
fall of his cabinet Antonelli created for himself the governorship
of the sacred palaces in order to retain constant access to and
influence over the pope. After the assassination of Pellegrino
Rossi (15th November 1848) he arranged the flight of Pius IX.
to Gaeta, where he was appointed secretary of state. Notwithstanding
promises to the powers, he restored absolute government
upon returning to Rome (12th April 1850) and violated
the conditions of the surrender by wholesale imprisonment of
Liberals. In 1855 he narrowly escaped assassination. As ally
of the Bourbons of Naples, from whom he had received an annual
subsidy, he attempted, after 1860, to facilitate their restoration
by fomenting brigandage on the Neapolitan frontier. To the
overtures of Ricasoli in 1861, Pius IX., at Antonelli&rsquo;s suggestion,
replied with the famous &ldquo;<i>Non possumus</i>,&rdquo; but subsequently
(1867) accepted, too late, Ricasoli&rsquo;s proposal concerning
ecclesiastical property. After the September Convention (1864)
Antonelli organized the Legion of Antibes to replace French
troops in Rome, and in 1867 secured French aid against Garibaldi&rsquo;s
invasion of papal territory. Upon the reoccupation of
Rome by the French after Mentana, Antonelli again ruled
supreme, but upon the entry of the Italians in 1870 was obliged
to restrict his activity to the management of foreign relations.
He wrote, with papal approval, the letter requesting the Italians
to occupy the Leonine city, and obtained from the Italians
payment of the Peter&rsquo;s pence (5,000,000 lire) remaining in the
papal exchequer, as well as 50,000 scudi&mdash;the first and only
instalment of the Italian allowance (subsequently fixed by the
Law of Guarantees, March 21, 1871) ever accepted by the Holy
See. At Antonelli&rsquo;s death the Vatican finances were found to
be in disorder, with a deficit of 45,000,000 lire. His personal
fortune, accumulated during office, was considerable, and was
bequeathed almost entirely to members of his family. To the
Church he left little and to the pope only a trifling souvenir.
From 1850 until his death he interfered little in affairs of dogma
and church discipline, although he addressed to the powers
circulars enclosing the Syllabus (1864) and the acts of the
Vatican Council (1870). His activity was devoted almost
exclusively to the struggle between the papacy and the Italian
<i>Risorgimento</i>, the history of which is comprehensible only when
the influence exercised by his unscrupulous, grasping and
sinister personality is fully taken into account. He died on the
6th of November 1876.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTONELLO DA MESSINA<a name="ar161" id="ar161"></a></span> (<i>c</i>. 1430-1479), Italian painter,
was probably born at Messina about the beginning of the 15th
century, and laboured at his art for some time in his native
country. Happening to see at Naples a painting in oil by Jan
Van Eyck, belonging to Alphonso of Aragon, he was struck by
the peculiarity and value of the new method, and set out for the
Netherlands to acquire a knowledge of the process from Van
Eyck&rsquo;s disciples. He spent some time there in the prosecution
of his art; returned with his secret to Messina about 1465;
probably visited Milan; removed to Venice in 1472, where he
painted for the Council of Ten; and died there in the middle of
February 1479 (see Venturi&rsquo;s article in Thieme-Becker, <i>Kunstlerlexikon</i>,
1907). His style is remarkable for its union&mdash;not always
successful&mdash;of Italian simplicity with Flemish love of detail.
His subjects are frequently single figures, upon the complete
representation of which he bestows his utmost skill. There
are extant&mdash;besides a number more or less dubious&mdash;twenty
authentic productions, consisting of renderings of &ldquo;Ecce Homo,&rdquo;
Madonnas, saints, and half-length portraits, many of them
painted on wood. The finest of all is said to be the nameless
picture of a man in the Berlin museum. The National Gallery,
London, has three works by him, including the &ldquo;St Jerome in
his Study.&rdquo; Antonello exercised an important influence on
Italian painting, not only by the introduction of the Flemish
invention, but also by the transmission of Flemish tendencies.</p>

(1389-1459), archbishop of Florence, was born at that
city on the 1st of March 1389. He entered the Dominican order in
his 16th year, and was soon entrusted, in spite of his youth, with
the government of various houses of his order at Cortona, Rome,
Naples and Florence, which he laboured zealously to reform.
He was consecrated archbishop of Florence in 1446, and won the
esteem and love of his people, especially by his energy and
resource in combating the effects of the plague and earthquake
in 1448 and 1453. He died on the 2nd of May 1459, and was
canonized by Pope Adrian VI. in 1523. His feast is annually
celebrated on the 13th of May. Antoninus had a great reputation
for theological learning, and sat as papal theologian at the
council of Florence (1439). Of his various works, the list of
which is given in Quétif-Echard, <i>De Scriptoribus Ord. Praedicat</i>.,
i. 818, the best-known are his <i>Summa theologica</i> (Venice, 1477;
Verona, 1740) and the <i>Summa confessionalis</i> (Mondovi, 1472),

Arrius Antoninus</span>], (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 86-161), Roman emperor <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 138-161,
the son of Aurelius Fulvus, a Roman consul whose family
had originally belonged to Nemausus (Nîmes), was born near
Lanuvium on the 19th of September 86. After the death of his
father, he was brought up under the care of Arrius Antoninus,
his maternal grandfather, a man of integrity and culture, and
on terms of friendship with the younger Pliny. Having filled
with more than usual success the offices of quaestor and praetor,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>149</span>
he obtained the consulship in 120; he was next chosen one of the
four consulars for Italy, and greatly increased his reputation
by his conduct as proconsul of Asia. He acquired much influence
with the emperor Hadrian, who adopted him as his son and
successor on the 25th of February 138, after the death of his first
adopted son Aelius Verus, on condition that he himself adopted
Marcus Annius Verus, his wife&rsquo;s brother&rsquo;s son, and Lucius, son
of Aelius Verus, afterwards the emperors Marcus Aurelius and
Lucius Aelius Verus (colleague of Marcus Aurelius). A few
months afterwards, on Hadrian&rsquo;s death, he was enthusiastically
welcomed to the throne by the Roman people, who, for once,
were not disappointed in their anticipation of a happy reign.
For Antoninus came to his new office with simple tastes, kindly
disposition, extensive experience, a well-trained intelligence and
the sincerest desire for the welfare of his subjects. Instead of
plundering to support his prodigality, he emptied his private
treasury to assist distressed provinces and cities, and everywhere
exercised rigid economy (hence the nickname <span class="grk" title="kuminopristaes">&#954;&#965;&#956;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#960;&#961;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span>,
&ldquo;cummin-splitter&rdquo;). Instead of exaggerating into treason
whatever was susceptible of unfavourable interpretation, he
turned the very conspiracies that were formed against him into
opportunities of signalizing his clemency. Instead of stirring
up persecution against the Christians, he extended to them the
strong hand of his protection throughout the empire. Rather
than give occasion to that oppression which he regarded as
inseparable from an emperor&rsquo;s progress through his dominions,
he was content to spend all the years of his reign in Rome, or its
neighbourhood. Under his patronage the science of jurisprudence
was cultivated by men of high ability, and a number of
humane and equitable enactments were passed in his name.
Of the public transactions of this period we have but scant
information, but, to judge by what we possess, those twenty-two
years were not remarkably eventful. One of his first acts was
to persuade the senate to grant divine honours to Hadrian, which
they had at first refused; this gained him the title of Pius (dutiful
in affection). He built temples, theatres, and mausoleums,
promoted the arts and sciences, and bestowed honours and
salaries upon the teachers of rhetoric and philosophy. His
reign was comparatively peaceful. Insurrections amongst the
Moors, Jews, and Brigantes in Britain were easily put down.
The one military result which is of interest to us now is the
building in Britain of the wall of Antoninus from the Forth to
the Clyde. In his domestic relations Antoninus was not so
fortunate. His wife, Faustina, has almost become a byword for
her lack of womanly virtue; but she seems to have kept her
hold on his affections to the last. On her death he honoured
her memory by the foundation of a charity for orphan girls, who
bore the name of <i>Alimentariae Faustinianae</i>. He had by her
two sons and two daughters; but they all died before his elevation
to the throne, except Annia Faustina, who became the wife
of Marcus Aurelius. Antoninus died of fever at Lorium in Etruria,
about 12 m. from Rome, on the 7th of March 161, giving
the keynote to his life in the last word that he uttered when
the tribune of the night-watch came to ask the password&mdash;<i>aequanimitas</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTONIO,<a name="ar166" id="ar166"></a></span> known as &ldquo;<span class="sc">The Prior of Crato</span>&rdquo; (1531-1595),
claimant of the throne of Portugal, was the natural son of Louis
(Luis), duke of Beja, by Yolande (Violante) Gomez, a Jewess,
who is said to have died a nun. His father was a younger
son of Emanuel, king of Portugal (1495-1521). Antonio was
educated at Coimbra, and was placed in the order of St John.
He was endowed with the wealthy priory of Crato. Little is
known of his life till 1578. In that year he accompanied King
Sebastian (1557-1578) in his invasion of Morocco, and was
taken prisoner by the Moors at the battle of Alcazar-Kebir, in
which the king was slain. Antonio is said to have secured his
release on easy terms by a fiction. He was asked the meaning
of the cross of St John which he wore on his doublet, and replied
that it was the sign of a small benefice which he held from the
pope, and would lose if he were not back by the 1st of January.
His captor, believing him to be a poor man, allowed him to
escape for a small ransom. On his return to Portugal he found
that his uncle, the cardinal Henry, only surviving son of King
John III. (1521-1557), had been recognized as king. The
cardinal was old, and was the last legitimate male representative
of the royal line (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Portugal</a></span>: <i>History</i>). The succession was
claimed by Philip II. of Spain. Antonio, relying on the popular
hostility to a Spanish ruler, presented himself as a candidate.
He had endeavoured to prove that his father and mother had
been married after his birth. There was, however, no evidence
of the marriage. Antonio&rsquo;s claim, which was inferior not only
to that of Philip II., but to that of the duchess of Braganza, was
not supported by the nobles or gentry. His partisans were
drawn exclusively from the inferior clergy, the peasants and
workmen. The prior endeavoured to resist the army which
Philip II. marched into Portugal to enforce his pretensions, but
was easily routed by the duke of Alva, the Spanish commander,
at Alcantara, on the 25th of August 1580. At the close of the
year, or in the first days of 1581, he fled to France carrying with
him the crown jewels, which included many valuable diamonds.
He was well received by Catherine de&rsquo; Medici, who had a claim
of her own on the crown of Portugal, and looked upon him
as a convenient instrument to be used against Philip II. By
promising to cede the Portuguese colony of Brazil to her, and
by the sale of part of his jewels, Antonio secured means to fit
out a fleet manned by Portuguese exiles and French and English
adventurers. As the Spaniards had not yet occupied the Azores
he sailed to them, but was utterly defeated at sea by the marquis
of Santa Cruz off Saint Michael&rsquo;s on the 27th of July 1582.
He now returned to France, and lived for a time at Ruel near
Paris. Peril from the assassins employed by Philip II. to remove
him drove Antonio from one refuge to another, and he finally
came to England. Elizabeth favoured him for much the same
reasons as Catherine de&rsquo; Medici. In 1589, the year after the
Armada, he accompanied an English expedition under the command
of Drake and Norris to the coast of Spain and Portugal.
The force consisted partly of the queen&rsquo;s ships, and in part of
privateers who went in search of booty. Antonio, with all the
credulity of an exile, believed that his presence would provoke
a general rising against Philip II., but none took place, and
the expedition was a costly failure. In 1590 the pretender left
England and returned to France, where he fell into poverty.
His remaining diamonds were disposed of by degrees. The last
and finest was acquired by M. de Sancy, from whom it was
purchased by Sully and included in the jewels of the crown.
During his last days he lived as a private gentleman on a small
pension given him by Henry IV., and he died in Paris on the
26th of August 1595. He left two illegitimate sons, and his
descendants can be traced till 1687. In addition to papers
published to defend his claims Antonio was the author of the
<i>Panegyrus Alphonsi Lusitanorum Regis</i> (Coimbra, 1550), and of a
cento of the Psalms, <i>Psalmi Confessionales</i> (Paris 1592), which
was translated into English under the title of <i>The Royal Penitent</i>
by Francis Chamberleyn (London, 1659), and into German as
<i>Heilige Betrachtungen</i> (Marburg, 1677).</p>

<div class="condensed">

English, and Spanish state papers of the time. A life of him, attributed

at Salamanca (1636-1639), he returned to his native city, wrote
his treatise <i>De Exilio</i> (which was not printed till 1659), and began
his monumental register of Spanish writers. The fame of his

of Spanish authors who flourished after 1500, appeared at Rome
in 1672; the <i>Bibliotheca Hispana vetus</i>, a literary history of
Spain from the time of Augustus to the end of the 15th century,
was revised by Manuel Martí, and published by Antonio&rsquo;s friend,
Cardinal José Saenz de Aguirre at Rome in 1696. A fine edition
of both parts, with additional matter found in Antonio&rsquo;s manuscripts,

Spanish scholar, was born at Lebrija in the province of
Andalusia. After studying at Salamanca he resided for ten years
in Italy, and completed his education at Bologna University.
On his return to Spain (1473), he devoted himself to the advancement
of classical learning amongst his countrymen. After
holding the professorship of poetry and grammar at Salamanca,
he was transferred to the university of Alcalá de Henares, where
he lectured until his death in 1522, at the age of seventy-eight.
His services to the cause of classical literature in Spain have
been compared with those rendered by Valla, Erasmus and
Budaeus to Italy, Holland and France. He produced a large
number of works on a variety of subjects, including a Latin
and Spanish dictionary, commentaries on Sedulius and Persius,
and a Compendium of Rhetoric, based on Aristotle, Cicero and
Quintilian. His most ambitious work was his chronicle entitled
<i>Rerum in Hispania Gestarum Decades</i> (published in 1545 by his
son as an original work by his father), which twenty years later
was found to be merely a Latin translation of the Spanish
chronicle of Pulgar, which was published at Saragossa in 1567.

<p><span class="bold">ANTONIUS,<a name="ar169" id="ar169"></a></span> the name of a large number of prominent citizens
of ancient Rome, of the gens Antonia. Antonius the triumvir
claimed that his family was descended from Anton, son of
Heracles. Of the Antonii the following are important.</p>

<p>1. <span class="sc">Marcus Antonius</span> (143-87 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), one of the most distinguished
Roman orators of his time, was quaestor in 113, and
praetor in 102 with proconsular powers, the province of Cilicia
being assigned to him. Here he was so successful against the
pirates that a naval triumph was awarded him. He was consul
in 99, censor 97, and held a command in the Marsic War in 90.
An adherent of Sulla, he was put to death by Marius and Cinna
when they obtained possession of Rome (87). Antonius&rsquo;s reputation
for eloquence rests on the authority of Cicero, none of his
orations being extant. He is one of the chief speakers in Cicero&rsquo;s
<i>De Oratore</i>.</p>

</div>

<p>2. <span class="sc">Marcus Antonius</span>, nicknamed <span class="sc">Creticus</span> in derision, elder
son of Marcus Antonius, the &ldquo;orator,&rdquo; and father of the triumvir.
He was praetor in 74 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and received an extraordinary command
(similar to that bestowed upon Pompey by the Gabinian
law) to clear the sea of pirates, and thereby assist the operations
against Mithradates VI. He failed in the task, and made himself
unpopular by plundering the provinces (Sallust, <i>Hist.</i> iii.,
fragments ed. B. Maurenbrecher, p. 108; Velleius Paterculus ii.
31; Cicero, <i>In Verrem</i>, iii. 91). He attacked the Cretans, who
had made an alliance with the pirates, but was totally defeated,
most of his ships being sunk. Diodorus Siculus (xl. 1) states
that he only saved himself by a disgraceful treaty. He died
soon afterwards (72-71) in Crete. All authorities are agreed as
to his avarice and incompetence.</p>

<p>3. <span class="sc">Gaius Antonius</span>, nicknamed <span class="sc">Hybrida</span> from his half-savage
disposition (Pliny, <i>Nat. Hist.</i> viii. 213), second son of Marcus
Antonius, the &ldquo;orator,&rdquo; and uncle of the triumvir. He was one
of Sulla&rsquo;s lieutenants in the Mithradatic War, and, after Sulla&rsquo;s
return, remained in Greece to plunder with a force of cavalry.
In 76 he was tried for his malpractices, but escaped punishment;
six years later he was removed from the senate by the censors,
but soon afterwards reinstated. In spite of his bad reputation,
he was elected tribune in 71, praetor in 66, and consul with
Cicero in 63. He secretly supported Catiline, but Cicero won
him over by promising him the rich province of Macedonia. On
the outbreak of the Catilinarian conspiracy, Antonius was obliged
to lead an army into Etruria, but handed over the command on
the day of battle to Marcus Petreius on the ground of ill-health.
He then went to Macedonia, where he made himself so detested
by his oppression and extortions that he left the province, and
was accused in Rome (59) both of having taken part in the
conspiracy and of extortion in his province. It was said that
Cicero had agreed with Antonius to share his plunder. Cicero&rsquo;s
defence of Antonius two years before in view of a proposal for
his recall, and also on the occasion of his trial, increased the
suspicion. In spite of Cicero&rsquo;s eloquence, Antonius was condemned,
and went into exile at Cephallenia. He seems to have
been recalled by Caesar, since he was present at a meeting of the
senate in 44, and was censor in 42.</p>

<p>4. <span class="sc">Marcus Antonius</span>, commonly called <span class="sc">Mark Antony</span>, the
Triumvir, grandson of Antonius the &ldquo;orator&rdquo; and son of
Antonius Creticus, related on his mother&rsquo;s side to Julius Caesar,
was born about 83 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> Under the influence of his stepfather,
Cornelius Lentulus Sura, he spent a profligate youth. For a time
he co-operated with P. Clodius Pulcher, probably out of hostility
to Cicero, who had caused Lentulus Sura to be put to death as
a Catilinarian; the connexion was severed by a disagreement
arising from his relations with Clodius&rsquo;s wife, Fulvia. In 58 he
fled to Greece to escape his creditors. After a short time spent
in attendance on the philosophers at Athens, he was summoned
by Aulus Gabinius, governor of Syria, to take part in the campaigns
against Aristobulus in Palestine, and in support of Ptolemy
Auletes in Egypt. In 54 he was with Caesar in Gaul. Raised by
Caesar&rsquo;s influence to the offices of quaestor, augur, and tribune
of the plebs, he supported the cause of his patron with great
energy, and was expelled from the senate-house when the Civil
War broke out. Deputy-governor of Italy during Caesar&rsquo;s
absence in Spain (49), second in command in the decisive battle
of Pharsalus (48), and again deputy-governor of Italy while
Caesar was in Africa (47), Antony was second only to the dictator,
and seized the opportunity of indulging in the most extravagant
excesses, depicted by Cicero in the <i>Philippics</i>. In 46 he seems
to have taken offence because Caesar insisted on payment for
the property of Pompey which Antony professedly had purchased,
but had in fact simply appropriated. The estrangement was not
of long continuance; for we find Antony meeting the dictator
at Narbo the following year, and rejecting the suggestion of
Trebonius that he should join in the conspiracy that was already
on foot. In 44 he was consul with Caesar, and seconded his
ambition by the famous offer of the crown at the festival of
Lupercalia (February 15). After the murder of Caesar on the
15th of March, Antony conceived the idea of making himself
sole ruler. At first he seemed disposed to treat the conspirators
leniently, but at the same time he so roused the people against
them by the publication of Caesar&rsquo;s will and by his eloquent
funeral oration, that they were obliged to leave the city. He
surrounded himself with a bodyguard of Caesar&rsquo;s veterans, and
forced the senate to transfer to him the province of Cisalpine
Gaul, which was then administered by Decimus Junius Brutus,
one of the conspirators. Brutus refused to surrender the
province, and Antony set out to attack him in October 44,

But at this time Octavian, whom Caesar had adopted as his son,
arrived from Illyria, and claimed the inheritance of his &ldquo;father.&rdquo;
Octavian obtained the support of the senate and of Cicero;
and the veteran troops of the dictator flocked to his standard.
Antony was denounced as a public enemy, and Octavian was
entrusted with the command of the war against him. Antony
was defeated at Mutina (43) where he was besieging Brutus.
The consuls Aulus Hirtius and C. Vibius Pansa, however, fell in
the battle, and the senate became suspicious of Octavian, who,
irritated at the refusal of a triumph and the appointment of
Brutus to the command over his head, entered Rome at the
head of his troops, and forced the senate to bestow the consulship
upon him (August 19th). Meanwhile, Antony escaped to
Cisalpine Gaul, effected a junction with Lepidus and marched
towards Rome with a large force of infantry and cavalry.
Octavian betrayed his party, and came to terms with Antony
and Lepidus. The three leaders met at Bononia and adopted the
title of <i>Triumviri reipublicae constituendae</i> as joint rulers. Gaul
was to belong to Antony, Spain to Lepidus, and Africa, Sardinia
and Sicily to Octavian. The arrangement was to last for five
years. A reign of terror followed; proscriptions, confiscations,
and executions became general; some of the noblest citizens
were put to death, and Cicero fell a victim to Antony&rsquo;s revenge.
In the following year (42) Antony and Octavian proceeded against
the conspirators Cassius and Brutus, and by the two battles
of Philippi annihilated the senatorial and republican parties.
Antony proceeded to Greece, and thence to Asia Minor, to
procure money for his veterans and complete the subjugation
of the eastern provinces. On his passage through Cilicia in 41
he fell a victim to the charms of Cleopatra, in whose company he
spent the winter at Alexandria. At length he was aroused by
the Parthian invasion of Syria and the report of an outbreak
between Fulvia his wife and Lucius his brother on the one hand
and Octavian on the other. On arriving in Italy he found that
Octavian was already victorious; on the death of Fulvia, a
reconciliation was effected between the triumvirs, and cemented
by the marriage of Antony with Octavia, the sister of his colleague.
A new division of the Roman world was made at
Brundusium, Lepidus receiving Africa, Octavian the west, and
Antony the east. Returning to his province Antony made
several attempts to subdue the Parthians, without any decided
success. In 39 he visited Athens, where he behaved in a most
extravagant manner, assuming the attributes of the god
Dionysus. In 37 he crossed over to Italy, and renewed the
triumvirate for five years at a meeting with Octavian. Returning
to Syria, he resumed relations with Cleopatra. His treatment
of Octavia, her brother&rsquo;s desire to get rid of him, and the manner
in which he disposed of kingdoms and provinces in favour of
Cleopatra alienated his supporters. In 32 the senate deprived
him of his powers and declared war against Cleopatra. After
two years spent in preparations, Antony was defeated at the
battle of Actium (2nd September 31). Once more he sought
refuge in the society of Cleopatra, who had escaped with sixty
ships to Egypt. He was pursued by his enemies and his
troops abandoned him. Thereupon he committed suicide in the
mistaken belief that Cleopatra had already done so (30 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>).
Antony had been married in succession to Fadia, Antonia, Fulvia
and Octavia, and left behind him a number of children.</p>

Creticus, and brother of the triumvir. In 44, as tribune of the
people, he brought forward a law authorizing Caesar to nominate
the chief magistrates during his absence from Rome. After the
murder of Caesar, he supported his brother Marcus. He proposed
an agrarian law in favour of the people and Caesar&rsquo;s
veterans, and took part in the operations at Mutina (43). In 41
he was consul, and had a dispute with Octavian, which led to
the so-called Perusian War, in which he was supported by Fulvia
(Mark Antony&rsquo;s wife), who was anxious to recall her husband
from Cleopatra&rsquo;s court. Later, observing the bitter feelings
that had been evoked by the distribution of land among the
veterans of Caesar, Antonius and Fulvia changed their attitude,
and stood forward as the defenders of those who had suffered
from its operation. Antonius marched on Rome, drove out
Lepidus, and promised the people that the triumvirate should be
abolished. On the approach of Octavian, he retired to Perusia
in Etruria, where he was besieged by three armies, and compelled
to surrender (winter of 41). His life was spared, and he was sent
by Octavian to Spain as governor. Nothing is known of the
circumstances or date of his death. Cicero, in his <i>Philippics</i>,
actuated in great measure by personal animosity, gives a highly
unfavourable view of his character.</p>

was destroyed; Antonius was shut up in the island of Curicta
and forced to surrender. In 44 he was city praetor, his brothers
Marcus and Lucius being consul and tribune respectively in the
same year. Gaius was appointed to the province of Macedonia,
but on his way thither fell into the hands of M. Junius Brutus
on the coast of Illyria. Brutus at first treated him generously,

<p><span class="bold">ANTRAIGUES, EMMANUEL HENRI LOUIS ALEXANDRE DE LAUNAY,<a name="ar171" id="ar171"></a></span>
<span class="sc">Comte D&rsquo;</span> (<i>c.</i> 1755-1812), French publicist and
political adventurer, was a nephew of François Emmanuel de
Saint-Priest (1735-1821), one of the last ministers of Louis XVI.
He was a cavalry captain, but, having little taste for the army,
left it and travelled extensively, especially in the East. On his
return to Paris, he sought the society of philosophers and artists,
visited Voltaire at Ferney for three months, but was more
attracted by J.J. Rousseau, with whom he became somewhat
intimate. He published a <i>Mémoire sur les états-généraux</i>, supported
the Revolution enthusiastically when it broke out, was
elected deputy, and took the oath to the constitution; but
he suddenly changed his mind completely, became a defender
of the monarchy and emigrated in 1790. He was the secret
agent of the comte de Provence (Louis XVIII.) at different
courts of Europe, and at the same time received money from
the courts he visited. He published a number of pamphlets,
<i>Des monstres ravagent partout</i>, <i>Point d&rsquo;accommodement</i>, &amp;c.
At Venice, where he was attaché to the Russian legation, he was
arrested in 1797, but escaped to Russia. Sent as Russian attaché
to Dresden, he published a violent pamphlet against Napoleon I.,
and was expelled by the Saxon government. He then went to
London, and it was universally believed that he betrayed the
secret articles of the treaty of Tilsit to the British cabinet, but
his recent biographer, Pingaud, contests this. In 1812 he and
his wife Madame Saint-Huberty, an operatic singer, were assassinated
by an Italian servant whom they had dismissed. It has
never been known whether the murder was committed from
private or political motives.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTRIM, RANDAL MACDONNELL,<a name="ar172" id="ar172"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Earl of</span> (d. 1636),
called &ldquo;Arranach,&rdquo; having been brought up in the Scottish
island of Arran by the Hamiltons, was the 4th son of Sorley
Boy MacDonnell (<i>q.v.</i>), and of Mary, daughter of Conn O&rsquo;Neill,
1st earl of Tyrone. He fought at first against the English
government, participating in his brother James&rsquo;s victory over
Sir John Chichester at Carrickfergus in November 1597, and
joining in O&rsquo;Neill&rsquo;s rebellion in 1600. But on the 16th of
December he signed articles with Sir Arthur Chichester and
was granted protection; in 1601 he became head of his house by
his elder brother&rsquo;s death, his pardon being confirmed to him;
and in 1602 he submitted to Lord Mountjoy and was knighted.
On the accession of James I. in 1603 he obtained a grant of the
Route and the Glynns (Glens) districts, together with the island
of Rathlin, and remained faithful to the government in spite
of the unpopularity he thereby incurred among his kinsmen,
who conspired to depose him. In 1607 he successfully defended
himself against the charge of disloyalty on the occasion of the
flight of the earls of Tyrone and Tyrconnell, and rendered
services to the government by settling and civilizing his districts,
being well received the following year by James in London. In
1618 he was created Viscount Dunluce, and subsequently he
was appointed a privy councillor and lord-lieutenant of the
county of Antrim. On the 12th of December 1620 he was
created earl of Antrim. In 1621 he was charged with harbouring
Roman Catholic priests, confessed his offence and was pardoned.
He offered his assistance in 1625 during the prospect of a Spanish
invasion, but was still regarded as a person that needed watching.
His arbitrary conduct in Ireland in 1627 was suggested as a fit
subject for examination by the Star Chamber, but his fidelity
to the government was strictly maintained to the last. In 1631
he was busy repairing Protestant churches, and in 1634 he
attended the Irish parliament. He made an important agreement
in 1635 for the purchase from James Campbell, Lord
Cantire, of the lordship of Cantire, or Kintyre, of which the
MacDonnells had been dispossessed in 1600 by Argyll; but his
possession was successfully opposed by Lord Lorne. He died
on the 10th of December 1636. Antrim married Alice, daughter
of Hugh O&rsquo;Neill, earl of Tyrone, by whom, besides six daughters,
he had Randal, 2nd earl and 1st marquess of Antrim (<i>q.v.</i>), and
Alexander, 3rd earl. Three other sons, Maurice, Francis and
James, were probably illegitimate. The earldom has continued
in the family down to the present day, the 11th earl (b. 1851)
succeeding in 1869.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTRIM, RANDAL MACDONNELL,<a name="ar173" id="ar173"></a></span> <span class="sc">1st Marquess</span> of (1609-1683),
son of the 1st earl of Antrim, was born in 1609 and educated
as a Roman Catholic. He travelled abroad, and on his
return in 1634 went to court, next year marrying Katherine
Manners, widow of the 1st duke of Buckingham, and living on
her fortune for some years in great splendour. In 1639, on the
outbreak of the Scottish war, he initiated a scheme of raising a
force in Ireland to attack Argyll in Scotland and recover Kintyre
(or Cantire), a district formerly possessed by his family; but
the plan, discouraged and ridiculed by Strafford, miscarried.<a name="fa1g" id="fa1g" href="#ft1g"><span class="sp">1</span></a>
Soon afterwards he returned to Ireland, and sought in 1641 to
create a diversion, together with Ormonde, for Charles I. against
the parliament. He joined in his schemes Lord Slane and Sir
Phelim O&rsquo;Neill, later leaders of the rebellion, but on the outbreak
of the rebellion in the autumn he dissociated himself from his
allies and retired to his castle at Dunluce. His suspicious conduct,
however, and his Roman Catholicism, caused him to be regarded
as an enemy by the English party. In May 1642 he was captured
at Dunluce Castle by the parliamentary general Robert Munro,
and imprisoned at Carrickfergus. Escaping thence he joined
the queen at York; and subsequently, having proceeded to
Ireland to negotiate a cessation of hostilities, he was again
captured with his papers in May 1643 and confined at Carrickfergus,
thence once more escaping and making his way to
Kilkenny, the headquarters of the Roman Catholic confederation.
He returned to Oxford in December with a scheme for
raising 10,000 Irish for service in England and 2000 to join
Montrose in Scotland, which through the influence of the duchess
of Buckingham secured the consent of the king. On the 26th of
January 1644 Antrim was created a marquess. He returned to
Kilkenny in February, took the oath of association, and was
made a member of the council and lieutenant-general of the
forces of the Catholic confederacy. The confederacy, however,
giving him no support in his projects, he threw up his commission,
and with Ormonde&rsquo;s help despatched about 1600 men in June to
Montrose&rsquo;s assistance in Scotland, subsequently returning to
Oxford and being sent by the king in 1645 with letters for the
queen at St Germains. He proceeded thence to Flanders and
fitted out two frigates with military stores, which he brought to
the prince of Wales at Falmouth. He visited Cork and afterwards
in July 1646 joined his troops in Scotland, with the hope
of expelling Argyll from Kintyre; but he was obliged to retire
by order of the king, and returning to Ireland threw himself
into the intrigues between the various factions. In 1647 he was
appointed with two others by the confederacy to negotiate a
treaty with the prince of Wales in France, and though he anticipated
his companions by starting a week before them, he failed
to secure the coveted lord-lieutenancy, which was confirmed
to Ormonde. He now ceased to support the Roman Catholics
or the king&rsquo;s cause; opposed the treaty between Ormonde and
the confederates; supported the project of union between
O&rsquo;Neill and the parliament; and in 1649 entered into communications
with Cromwell, for whom he performed various
services, though there appears no authority to support Carte&rsquo;s
story that Antrim was the author of a forged agreement for the
betrayal of the king&rsquo;s army by Lord Inchiquin.<a name="fa2g" id="fa2g" href="#ft2g"><span class="sp">2</span></a> Subsequently
he joined Ireton, and was present at the siege of Carlow. He
returned to England in December 1650, and in lieu of his confiscated
estate received a pension of £500 and later of £800,
together with lands in Mayo. At the Restoration Antrim was
excluded from the Act of Oblivion on account of his religion,
and on presenting himself at court was imprisoned in the Tower,
subsequently being called before the lords justices in Ireland.
In 1663 he succeeded, in spite of Ormonde&rsquo;s opposition, in
securing a decree of innocence from the commissioners of claims.
This raised an outcry from the adventurers who had been put
in possession of his lands, and who procured a fresh trial; but
Antrim appealed to the king, and through the influence of the
queen mother obtained a pardon, his estates being restored
to him by the Irish, Act of Explanation in 1665.<a name="fa3g" id="fa3g" href="#ft3g"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Antrim died
on the 3rd of February 1683. He is described by Clarendon as
of handsome appearance but &ldquo;of excessive pride and vanity
and of a marvellous weak and narrow understanding.&rdquo; He
married secondly Rose, daughter of Sir Henry O&rsquo;Neill, but had
no children, being succeeded in the earldom by his brother
Alexander, 3rd earl of Antrim.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANTRIM,<a name="ar174" id="ar174"></a></span> a county in the north-east corner of Ireland, in
the province of Ulster. It is bounded N. and E. by the narrow
seas separating Ireland from Scotland, the Atlantic Ocean and
Irish Sea, S. by Belfast Lough and the Lagan river dividing it
from the county Down, W. by Lough Neagh, dividing it from
the counties Armagh and Tyrone, and by county Londonderry,
the boundary with which is the river Bann.</p>

<p>The area is 751,965 acres or about 1175 sq. m. A large portion
of the county is hilly, especially in the east, where the
highest elevations are attained, though these are nowhere great.
The range runs north and south, and, following this direction
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>153</span>
the highest points are Knocklayd (1695 ft.), Slieveanorra (1676),
Trostan (1817), Slemish (1457), and Divis (1567). The inland
slope is gradual, but on the northern shore the range terminates
in abrupt and almost perpendicular declivities, and here, consequently,
some of the finest coast scenery in the island is found,
widely differing, with its unbroken lines of cliffs, from the
indented coast-line of the west. The most remarkable cliffs are
those formed of perpendicular basaltic columns, extending for
many miles, and most strikingly displayed in Fair Head and the
celebrated Giant&rsquo;s Causeway. From the eastern coast the hills
rise instantly but less abruptly, and the indentations are wider
and deeper. On both coasts there are several frequented
watering-places, of which may be mentioned on the north
Portrush (with well-known golf links), Port Ballintrae and
Ballycastle; on the east Cushendun, Cushendall and Milltown on
Red Bay, Carn Lough and Glenarm, Larne, and Whitehead on
Belfast Lough. All are somewhat exposed to the easterly
winds prevalent in spring. The only island of size is Rathlin,
off Ballycastle, 6½ m. in length by 1½ in breadth, 7 m. from the
coast, and of similar basaltic and limestone formation to that
of the mainland. It is partially arable, and supports a small
population. The so-called Island Magee is a peninsula separating
Larne Lough from the Irish Channel.</p>

<p>The valleys of the Bann and Lagan, with the intervening
shores of Lough Neagh, form the fertile lowlands. These two
rivers, both rising in county Down, are the only ones of importance.
The latter flows to Belfast Lough, the former drains
Lough Neagh, which is fed by a number of smaller streams,
among them the Crumlin, whose waters have petrifying powers.
The fisheries of the Bann and of Lough Neagh (especially for
salmon) are of value both commercially and to sportsmen, the
small town of Toome, at the outflow of the river, being the
centre. Immediately below this point lies Lough Beg, the
&ldquo;Small Lake,&rdquo; about 15 ft. lower than Lough Neagh, which it
excels in the pleasant scenery of its banks. The smaller streams
are of great use in working machinery.</p>

<p><i>Geology.</i>&mdash;On entering the county at the south, a scarped
barrier of hills is seen beyond the Lagan valley, marking the
edge of the basaltic plateaus, and running almost continuously
round the coast to Red Bay. Below it, Triassic beds are exposed
from Lisburn to Island Magee, giving sections of red sands and
marls. Above these, marine Rhaetic beds appear at intervals,
notably near Larne, where they are succeeded by Lower Lias
shales and limestones. At Portrush, the Lower Lias is seen on
the shore, crowded with ammonites, but silicified and metamorphosed
by invading dolerite. The next deposits, as the
scarps are approached, are greensands of &ldquo;Selbornian&rdquo; age,
succeeded by Cenomanian, and locally by Turonian, sands.
The Senonian series is represented by the White Limestone, a
hardened chalk with flints, which is often glauconitic and conglomeratic
at the base. Denudation in earliest Eocene times has
produced flint gravels above the chalk, and an ancient stream
deposit of chalk pebbles occurs at Ballycastle. The volcanic
fissures that allowed of the upwelling of basalt are represented
by numerous dykes, many cutting the earlier lava-flows as well
as all the beds below them. The accumulations of lava gave
rise to the plateaus which form almost the whole interior of the
county. In a quiet interval, the Lower Eocene plant-beds of
Glenarm and Ballypalady were formed in lakes, where iron-ores
also accumulated. Rhyolites were erupted locally near Tardree,
Ballymena and Glenarm. The later basalts are especially marked
by columnar jointing, which determines the famous structures
of the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway and the coast near Bengore Head.
Volcanic necks may be recognized at Carrick-a-rede, in the
intrusive mass of dolerite at Slemish, at Carnmoney near Belfast,
and a few other points. Fair Head is formed of intrusive
dolerite, presenting a superb columnar seaward face. Faulting,
probably in Pliocene times, lowered the basaltic plateaus to
form the basin of Lough Neagh, leaving the eastern scarp at
heights ranging up to 1800 ft. The glens of Antrim are deep
notches cut by seaward-running streams through the basalt scarp,
their floors being formed of Triassic or older rocks. Unlike most
Irish counties, Antrim owes its principal features to rocks of
Mesozoic and Cainozoic age. At Cushendun, however, a coarse
conglomerate is believed to be Devonian, while Lower Carboniferous
Sandstones, with several coal-seams, form a small productive
basin at Ballycastle. The dolerite of Fair Head sends off
sheets along the bedding-planes of these carboniferous strata.
&ldquo;Dalradian&rdquo; schists and gneisses, with some dark limestones,
come out in the north-east of the county, forming a moorland-region
between Cushendun and Ballycastle. The dome of Knocklayd,
capped by an outlier of chalk and basalt, consists mostly
of this far more ancient series. Glacial gravels are well seen
near Antrim town, and as drumlins between Ballymena and
Ballycastle. The drift-phenomena connected with the flow of
ice from Scotland are of special interest. Recently elevated
marine clays, of post-glacial date, fringe the south-eastern coast,
while gravels with marine shells, side by side with flint implements
chipped by early man, have been lifted some 20 ft.
above sea-level near Larne.</p>

<p>Rock-salt some 80 ft. thick is mined in the Trias near
Carrickfergus. The Keuper clays yield material for bricks.
Bauxite, probably derived from the decay of lavas, is found
between Glenarm and Broughshane, associated with brown
and red pisolitic iron-ores; both these materials are worked
commercially. Bauxite occurs also near Ballintoy. The Ballycastle
coal is raised and sold locally.</p>

<p><i>Industries.</i>&mdash;The climate is very temperate. The soil varies
greatly according to the district, being in some cases a rich
loam, in others a chalky marl, and elsewhere showing a coating
of peat. The proportion of barren land to the total area is
roughly as 1 to 9; and of tillage to pasture as 2 to 3. Tillage
is therefore, relatively to other counties, well advanced, and
oats and potatoes are largely, though decreasingly, cultivated.
Flax is a less important crop than formerly. The numbers of
cattle, sheep, pigs and poultry are generally increasing. Dutch,
Ayrshire and other breeds are used to improve the breed of cattle
by crossing. Little natural wood remains in the county, but
plantations flourish on the great estates, and orchards have
proved successful.</p>

<p>The linen manufacture is the most important industry.
Cotton-spinning by jennies was first introduced by Robert Joy
and Thomas M&lsquo;Cabe of Belfast in 1777; and an estimate made
twenty-three years later showed upwards of 27,000 hands
employed in this industry within 10 m. of Belfast, which remains
the centre for it. Women are employed in the working of
patterns on muslin. There are several paper-mills at Bushmills
in the north; whisky-distilling is carried on; and there are
valuable sea-fisheries divided between the district of Ballycastle
and Carrickfergus, while the former is the headquarters of a
salmon-fishery district. The workings at the Ballycastle
collieries are probably the oldest in Ireland. In 1770 the miners
accidentally discovered a complete gallery, which has been
driven many hundred yards into the bed of coal, branching into
thirty-six chambers dressed quite square, and in a workman-like
manner. No tradition of the mine having been formerly worked
remained in the neighbourhood. The coal of some of the beds
is bituminous, and of others anthracite.</p>

<p><i>Communications.</i>&mdash;Except that the Great Northern railway
line from Belfast to the south and west runs for a short distance
close to the southern boundary of the county, with a branch
from Lisburn to the town of Antrim, the principal lines of
communication are those of the Northern Counties system,
under the control of the Midland railway of England. The chief
routes are:&mdash;Belfast, Antrim, Ballymena (and thence to
Coleraine and Londonderry); a line diverging from this at
White Abbey to Carrickfergus and Larne, the port for Stranraer
in Scotland; branches from Ballymena to Larne and to Parkmore;
and from Coleraine to Portrush. The Ballycastle
railway runs from Ballymoney to Ballycastle on the north
coast; and the Giant&rsquo;s Causeway and Portrush is an electric
railway (the first to be worked in the United Kingdom). The
Lagan Canal connects Lough Neagh with Belfast Lough.</p>

<p><i>Population and Administration.</i>&mdash;The population in 1891 was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page154" id="page154"></a>154</span>
208,010, and in 1901, 196,090. The county is among those
least seriously affected by emigration. Of the total about 50%
are Presbyterians, about 20% each Protestant Episcopalians
and Roman Catholics; Antrim being one of the most decidedly
Protestant counties in Ireland. Of the Presbyterians the
greater part are in connexion with the General Synod of Ulster,
and the other are Remonstrants, who separated from the Synod
in 1829, or United Presbyterians. The principal towns are
Antrim (pop. 1826), Ballymena (10,886), Ballymoney (2952),
Carrickfergus (4208), Larne (6670), Lisburn (11,461) and Portrush
(1941). Belfast though constituting a separate county
ranks as the metropolis of the district. Ballyclare, Bushmills,
Crumlin, Portglenone and Randalstown are among the lesser
towns. Belfast and Larne are the chief ports. The county
comprises 14 baronies and 79 civil parishes and parts of parishes.
The constabulary force has its headquarters at Ballymena.
The assize town is Belfast, and quarter sessions are held at
Ballymena, Ballymoney, Belfast, Larne and Lisburn. The
county is divided between the Protestant dioceses of Derry
and Down, and the Roman Catholic dioceses of Down and
Connor, and Dromore. It is divided into north, mid, east and
south parliamentary divisions, each returning one member.</p>

<p><i>History and Antiquities.</i>&mdash;At what date the county of Antrim
was formed is not known, but it appears that a certain district
bore this name before the reign of Edward II. (early 14th century),
and when the shiring of Ulster was undertaken by Sir
John Perrot in the 16th century, Antrim and Down were already
recognized divisions, in contradistinction to the remainder of
the province. The earliest known inhabitants were of Celtic
origin, and the names of the townlands or subdivisions, supposed
to have been made in the 13th century, are pure Celtic. Antrim
was exposed to the inroads of the Danes, and also of the northern
Scots, who ultimately effected permanent settlements. The
antiquities of the county consist of cairns, mounts or forts,
remains of ecclesiastical and military structures, and round
towers. The principal cairns are: one on Colin mountain, near
Lisburn; one on Slieve True, near Carrickfergus; and two on
Colinward. The cromlechs most worthy of notice are: one near
Cairngrainey, to the north-east of the old road from Belfast to
Templepatrick; the large cromlech at Mount Druid, near
Ballintoy; and one at the northern extremity of Island Magee.
The mounts, forts and intrenchments are very numerous. There
are three round towers: one at Antrim, one at Armoy, and one
on Ram Island in Lough Neagh, only that at Antrim being
perfect. There are some remains of the ecclesiastic establishments
at Bonamargy, where the earls of Antrim are buried,
Kells, Glenarm, Glynn, Muckamore and White Abbey. The
noble castle of Carrickfergus is the only one in perfect preservation.
There are, however, remains of other ancient castles, as
Olderfleet, Cam&rsquo;s, Shane&rsquo;s, Glenarm, Garron Tower, Redbay,
&amp;c., but the most interesting of all is the castle of Dunluce,
remarkable for its great extent and romantic situation.
Mount Slemish, about 8 m. east of Ballymena, is notable as
being the scene of St Patrick&rsquo;s early life. Island Magee had,
besides antiquarian remains, a notoriety as a home of witchcraft,
and was the scene of an act of reprisal for the much-disputed
massacre of Protestants about 1641, by the soldiery
of Carrickfergus.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANTRIM,<a name="ar175" id="ar175"></a></span> a market-town in the west of the county Antrim,
Ireland, in the south parliamentary division, on the banks of the
Six-Mile Water, half a mile from Lough Neagh, in a beautiful
and fertile valley. Pop. (1901) 1826. It is 21¾ m. north-west
of Belfast by the Northern Counties (Midland) railway, and is also
the terminus of a branch of the Great Northern railway from
Lisburn. There is nothing in the town specially worthy of
notice, but the environs, including Shane&rsquo;s Castle and Antrim
Castle, possess features of considerable interest. About a mile
from the town is one of the most perfect of the round towers of
Ireland, 93 ft. high and 50 in circumference at the base. It
stands in the grounds of Steeple, a neighbouring seat, where is
also the &ldquo;Witches&rsquo; Stone,&rdquo; a prehistoric monument. A battle
was fought near Antrim between the English and Irish in the
reign of Edward III.; and in 1642 a naval engagement took
place on Lough Neagh, for Viscount Massereene and Ferrard
(who founded Antrim Castle in 1662) had a right to maintain a
fighting fleet on the lough. On the 7th of June 1798 there was
a smart action in the town between the king&rsquo;s troops and a large
body of rebels, in which the latter were defeated, and Lord
O&rsquo;Neill mortally wounded. Before the Union Antrim returned
two members to parliament by virtue of letters patent granted
in 1666 by Charles II. There are manufactures of paper, linen,
and woollen cloth. The government is in the hands of town
commissioners.</p>


<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANTRUSTION,<a name="ar176" id="ar176"></a></span> the name of the members of the bodyguard or
military household of the Merovingian kings. The word, of which
the formation has been variously explained, is derived from the
O.H.Germ. <i>trost</i>, comfort, aid, fidelity, trust, through the latinized
form <i>trustis</i>. Our information about the antrustions is derived
from one of the <i>formulae</i> of Marculfus (i. 18, ed. Zeumer, p. 55)
and from various provisions of the Salic law (see du Cange,
<i>Glossarium, s.</i> &ldquo;trustis&rdquo;). Any one desiring to enter the body of
Antrustions had to present himself armed at the royal palace,
and there, with his hands in those of the king, take a special
oath or <i>trustis</i> and <i>fidelitas</i>, in addition to the oath of fidelity
sworn by every subject at the king&rsquo;s accession. This done, he
was considered to be <i>in truste dominica</i> and bound to the discharge of all the services this involved. In return for these, the
antrustion enjoyed certain valuable advantages, as being specially
entitled to the royal assistance and protection; his <i>wergeld</i>
is three times that of an ordinary Frank; the slayer of a Frank
paid compensation of 200 <i>solidi</i>, that of an antrustion had to
find 600. The antrustion was always of Frankish descent, and
only in certain exceptional cases were Gallo-Romans admitted
into the king&rsquo;s bodyguard. These Gallo-Romans then took the
name of <i>convivae regis</i>, and the <i>wergeld</i> of 300 <i>solidi</i> was three
times that of a <i>homo romanus</i>. The antrustions, belonging as
they did to one body, had strictly defined duties towards one
another; thus one antrustion was forbidden to bear witness
against another under penalty of 15 <i>solidi</i> compensation.</p>

<p>The antrustions seem to have played an important part at
the time of Clovis. It was they, apparently, who formed the
army which conquered the land, an army composed chiefly of
Franks, and of a few Gallo-Romans who had taken the side of
Clovis. After the conquest, the role of the antrustions became
less important. For each of their expeditions, the kings raised
an army of citizens in which the Gallo-Romans mingled more
and more with the Franks; they only kept one small permanent
body which acted as their bodyguard (<i>trustis dominica</i>), some
members of which were from time to time told off for other
tasks, such as that of forming garrisons in the frontier towns.
The institution seems to have disappeared during the anarchy
with which the 8th century opened. It has wrongly been held
to be the origin of vassalage. Only the king had antrustions;
every lord could have vassals. The antrustions were a military
institution; vassalage was a social institution, the origins of
which are very complex.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>All historians of Merovingian institutions and law have treated
of the antrustions, and each one has his different system. The
principal authorities are:&mdash;Waitz, <i>Deutsche Verfassungsgeschichte</i>,
3rd ed. vol. ii. pp. 335 et seq.; Brunner, <i>Deutsche Rechtsgeschichte</i>,
vol. ii. p. 97 et seq.; Fustel de Coulanges, <i>La Monarchie franque</i>,

les deux premieres races</i> (Paris, 1873), collecting and discussing the
principal texts; Guilhermoz, <i>Les Origines de la noblesse</i> (Paris, 1902),

<p><span class="bold">ANTWERP,<a name="ar177" id="ar177"></a></span> the most northern of the nine provinces of
Belgium. It is conterminous with the Dutch frontier on the
north. Malines, Lierre and Turnhout are among the towns of
the province. Its importance, however, is derived from the
fact that it contains the commercial metropolis of Belgium. It
is divided into three administrative districts (<i>arrondissements</i>),
viz. Antwerp, Malines and Turnhout. These are subdivided
into 25 cantons and 152 communes. The area is 707,932 acres
or 1106 sq. m. Pop. (1904) 888,980, showing an average of
804 inhabitants to the square mile.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANTWERP<a name="ar178" id="ar178"></a></span> (Fr. <i>Anvers</i>), capital of the above province, an
important city on the right bank of the Scheldt, Belgium&rsquo;s
chief centre of commerce and a strong fortified position.</p>

<p>Modern Antwerp is a finely laid out city with a succession of
broad avenues which mark the position of the first enceinte.
There are long streets and terraces of fine houses belonging to
the merchants and manufacturers of the city which amply
testify to its prosperity, and recall the 16th century distich that
Antwerp was noted for its moneyed men (&ldquo;Antwerpia nummis&rdquo;).
Despite the ravages of war and internal disturbances it still
preserves some memorials of its early grandeur, notably its fine
cathedral. This church was begun in the 14th century, but not
finished till 1518. Its tower of over 400 ft. is a conspicuous
object to be seen from afar over the surrounding flat country.
A second tower which formed part of the original plan has never
been erected. The proportions of the interior are noble, and in
the church are hung three of the masterpieces of Rubens, viz.
&ldquo;The Descent from the Cross,&rdquo; &ldquo;The Elevation of the Cross,&rdquo;
and &ldquo;The Assumption.&rdquo; Another fine church in Antwerp is
that of St James, far more ornate than the cathedral, and containing
the tomb of Rubens, who devoted himself to its embellishment.
The Bourse or exchange, which claims to be the
first distinguished by the former name in Europe, is a fine new
building finished in 1872, on the site of the old Bourse erected in
1531 and destroyed by fire in 1858. Fire has destroyed several
other old buildings in the city, notably in 1891 the house of the
Hansa League on the northern quays. A curious museum is
the Maison Plantin, the house of the great printer C. Plantin
(<i>q.v.</i>) and his successor Moretus, which stands exactly as it did
in the time of the latter. The new picture gallery close to the
southern quays is a fine building divided into ancient and
modern sections. The collection of old masters is very fine,
containing many splendid examples of Rubens, Van Dyck,
Titian and the chief Dutch masters. Antwerp, famous in the
middle ages and at the present time for its commercial enterprise,
enjoyed in the 17th century a celebrity not less distinct
or glorious in art for its school of painting, which included
Rubens, Van Dyck, Jordaens, the two Teniers and many others.</p>

<p><i>Commerce.</i>&mdash;Since 1863, when Antwerp was opened to the
trade of the outer world by the purchase of the Dutch right to
levy toll, its position has completely changed, and no place in
Europe has made greater progress in this period than the ancient
city on the Scheldt. The following figures for the years 1904
and 1905 show that its trade is still rapidly increasing:&mdash;</p>

<table class="ws" summary="Contents">
<tr><td class="tcc allb" rowspan="2">Year.</td> <td class="tcc allb" colspan="2">Exports.</td> <td class="tcc allb" colspan="2">Imports</td></tr>

<p>The growth of its commerce in recent times may be measured
by a comparison of the following figures. In 1888, 4272 ships
entered the port and 4302 sailed from it. In 1905, 6095 entered
the port and 6065 sailed from it&mdash;an increase of nearly 50%.
In 1888 the total tonnage was 7,800,000; in 1905 it had risen
to 19,662,000. These figures explain how and why Antwerp
has outgrown its dock accommodation. The eight principal
basins or docks already existing in 1908 were (1) the Little or
Bonaparte dock; (2) the Great dock, also constructed in
Napoleon&rsquo;s time; (3) the Kattendijk, built in 1860 and enlarged
in 1881; (4) the Wood dock; (5) the Campine dock, used especially
for minerals; (6) the Asia dock, which is in direct communication
with the Meuse by a canal as well as with the Scheldt; (7) the
Lefebvre dock; and (8) the America dock, which was only
opened in 1905. Two new docks, called &ldquo;intercalary&rdquo; because
they would fit into whatever scheme might be adopted for the
rectification of the course of the Scheldt, were still to be constructed, leading out of the Lefebvre dock and covering 70 acres.
With the completion of the new maritime lock, ships drawing
30 ft. of water would be able to enter these new docks and also
the Lefebvre and America docks. In connexion with the
projected <i>grande coupure</i> (that is, a cutting through the neck of
the loop in the river Scheldt immediately below Antwerp), the
importance of these four docks would be greatly increased
because they would then flank the new main channel of the river.
When the Belgian Chambers voted in February 1906 the sums
necessary for the improvement of the harbour of Antwerp no
definite scheme was sanctioned, the question being referred to
a special mixed commission. The improvements at Antwerp
are not confined to the construction of new docks. The quays
flanking the Scheldt are 3½ m. in length. They are constructed
of granite, and no expense has been spared in equipping them
with hydraulic cranes, warehouses, &amp;c.</p>

<p><i>Fortifications.</i>&mdash;Besides being the chief commercial port of
Belgium, Antwerp is the greatest fortress of that country.
Nothing, however, remains of the former enceinte or even of
the famous old citadel defended by General Chassé in 1832,
except the <i>Steen</i>, which has been restored and contains a museum
of arms and antiquities. After the establishment of Belgian
independence Antwerp was defended only by the citadel and
an enceinte of about 2½ m. round the city. No change occurred
till 1859, when the system of Belgian defence was radically
altered by the dismantlement of seventeen of the twenty-two
fortresses constructed under Wellington&rsquo;s supervision in 1815-1818.
At Antwerp the old citadel and enceinte were removed.
A new enceinte 8 m. in length was constructed, and the villages
of Berchem and Borgerhout, now parishes of Antwerp, were
absorbed within the city. This enceinte still exists, and is a
fine work of art. It is protected by a broad wet ditch (plans
in article <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Fortification</a></span>), and in the caponiers are the
magazines and store chambers of the fortress. The enceinte
is pierced by nineteen openings or gateways, but of these seven
are not used by the public. As soon as the enceinte was finished
eight detached forts from 2 to 2½ m. distant from the enceinte
were constructed. They begin on the north near Wyneghem
and the zone of inundation, and terminate on the south at
Hoboken. In 1870 Fort Merxem and the redoubts of Berendrecht
and Oorderen were built for the defence of the area to
be inundated north of Antwerp. In 1878, in consequence of the
increased range of artillery and the more destructive power of
explosives, it was recognized that the fortifications of Antwerp
were becoming useless and out of date. It was therefore decided
to change it from a fortress to a fortified position by constructing
an outer line of forts and batteries at a distance varying from
6 to 9 m. from the enceinte. This second line was to consist of
fifteen forts, large and small. Up to 1898 only five had been
constructed, but in that and the two following years five more
were finished, leaving another five to complete the line. A
mixed commission selected the points at which they were to be
placed. With the completion of this work, which in 1908 was
being rapidly pushed on, Antwerp might be regarded as one of
the best fortified positions in Europe, and so long as its communications
by sea are preserved intact it will be practically
impregnable.</p>

<p>Two subsidiary or minor problems remained over. (1) The
much-discussed removal of the existing enceinte in order to
give Antwerp further growing space. If it were removed there
arose the further question, should a new enceinte be made at
the first line of outer forts, or should an enceinte be dispensed
with? An enceinte following the line of those forts would be
30 m. in length. Then if the city grew up to this extended
enceinte the outer forts would be too near. To screen the city
from bombardment they would have to be carried 3 m. further
out, and the whole Belgian army would scarcely furnish an
adequate garrison for this extended position. A new enceinte,
or more correctly a rampart of a less permanent character,
connecting the eight forts of the inner line and extending from
Wyneghem to a little south of Hoboken, was decided upon in
1908. (2) The second problem was the position on the left
bank of the Scheldt. All the defences enumerated are on the
right bank. On the left bank the two old forts Isabelle and Marie
alone defend the Scheldt. It is assumed (probably rightly)
that no enemy could get round to this side in sufficient strength
to deliver any attack that the existing forts could not easily
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page156" id="page156"></a>156</span>
repel. The more interesting question connected with the left
bank is whether it does not provide, as Napoleon thought, the
most natural outlet for the expansion of Antwerp. Proposals to
connect the two banks by a tunnel under the Scheldt have been
made from time to time in a fitful manner, but nothing whatever
had been done by 1908 to realize what appears to be a natural
and easy project.</p>

<p><i>Population.</i>&mdash;The following statistics show the growth of
population in and since the 19th century. In 1800 the population
was computed not to exceed 40,000. At the census of 1846 the
total was 88,487; of 1851, 95,501; of 1880, 169,100; of 1900,
272,830; and of 1904, 291,949. To these figures ought to be
added the populations (1904) of Borgerhout (43,391) and Berchem
(26,383), as they are part of the city, which would give Antwerp
a total population of 361,723.</p>

<p><i>History.</i>&mdash;The suggested origin of the name Antwerp from
<i>Hand-werpen</i> (hand-throwing), because a mythical robber chief
indulged in the practice of cutting off his prisoners&rsquo; hands and
throwing them into the Scheldt, appeared to Motley rather far-fetched,
but it is less reasonable to trace it, as he inclines to do,
from <i>an t werf</i> (on the wharf), seeing that the form <i>Andhunerbo</i>
existed in the 6th century on the separation of Austrasia and
Neustria. Moreover, hand-cutting was not an uncommon
practice in Europe. It was perpetuated from a savage past in
the custom of cutting off the right hand of a man who died
without heir, and sending it as proof of <i>main-morte</i> to the feudal
lord. Moreover, the two hands and a castle, which form the
arms of Antwerp, will not be dismissed as providing no proof by
any one acquainted with the scrupulous care that heralds displayed
in the golden age of chivalry before assigning or recognizing
the armorial bearings of any claimant.</p>

<p>In the 4th century Antwerp is mentioned as one of the places
in the second Germany, and in the 11th century Godfrey of
Bouillon was for some years best known as marquis of Antwerp.
Antwerp was the headquarters of Edward III. during his early
negotiations with van Artevelde, and his son Lionel, earl of
Cambridge, was born there in 1338.</p>

<p>It was not, however, till after the closing of the Zwyn and the
decay of Bruges that Antwerp became of importance. At the
end of the 15th century the foreign trading gilds or houses were
transferred from Bruges to Antwerp, and the building assigned
to the English nation is specifically mentioned in 1510. In 1560,
a year which marked the highest point of its prosperity, six
nations, viz. the Spaniards, the Danes and the Hansa together,
the Italians, the English, the Portuguese and the Germans, were
named at Antwerp, and over 1000 foreign merchants were
resident in the city. Guicciardini, the Venetian envoy, describes
the activity of the port, into which 500 ships sometimes passed
in a day, and as evidence of the extent of its land trade he
mentioned that 2000 carts entered the city each week. Venice
had fallen from its first place in European commerce, but still
it was active and prosperous. Its envoy, in explaining the
importance of Antwerp, states that there was as much business
done there in a fortnight as in Venice throughout the year.</p>

<p>The religious troubles that marked the second half of the 16th
century broke out in Antwerp as in every other part of Belgium
excepting Liége. In 1576 the Spanish soldiery plundered the
town during what was called &ldquo;the Spanish Fury,&rdquo; and 6000
citizens were massacred. Eight hundred houses were burnt
down, and over two millions sterling of damage was wrought in
the town on that occasion.</p>

<p>In 1585 a severe blow was struck at the prosperity of Antwerp
when Parma captured it after a long siege and sent all its Protestant
citizens into exile. The recognition of the independence of
the United Provinces by the treaty of Munster in 1648 carried
with it the death-blow to Antwerp&rsquo;s prosperity as a place of
trade, for one of its clauses stipulated that the Scheldt should be
closed to navigation. This impediment remained in force until
1863, although the provisions were relaxed during French rule
from 1795 to 1814, and also during the time Belgium formed
part of the kingdom of the Netherlands (1815 to 1830). Antwerp
had reached the lowest point of its fortunes in 1800, and its
population had sunk under 40,000, when Napoleon, realizing its
strategical importance, assigned two millions for the construction
of two docks and a mole.</p>

<p>One other incident in the chequered history of Antwerp
deserves mention. In 1830 the city was captured by the Belgian
insurgents, but the citadel continued to be held by a Dutch
garrison under General Chasse. For a time this officer subjected
the town to a periodical bombardment which inflicted much
damage, and at the end of 1832 the citadel itself was besieged
by a French army. During this attack the town was further
injured. In December 1832, after a gallant defence, Chasse made
an honourable surrender.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">ANU,<a name="ar179" id="ar179"></a></span> a Babylonian deity, who, by virtue of being the first
figure in a triad consisting of Anu, Bel and Ea, came to be regarded
as the father and king of the gods. Anu is so prominently
associated with the city of Erech in southern Babylonia that
there are good reasons for believing this place to have been the
original seat of the Anu cult. If this be correct, then the goddess
Nana (or Ishtar) of Erech was presumably regarded as his
consort. The name of the god signifies the &ldquo;high one&rdquo; and he
was probably a god of the atmospheric region above the earth&mdash;
perhaps a storm god like Adad (<i>q.v.</i>), or like Yahweh among the
ancient Hebrews. However this may be, already in the old-Babylonian
period, <i>i.e.</i> before Khammurabi, Anu was regarded
as the god of the heavens and his name became in fact synonymous
with the heavens, so that in some cases it is doubtful
whether, under the term, the god or the heavens is meant. It
would seem from this that the grouping of the divine powers
recognized in the universe into a triad symbolizing the three
divisions, heavens, earth and the watery-deep, was a process
of thought which had taken place before the third millennium.
To Anu was assigned the control of the heavens, to Bel the
earth, and to Ea the waters. The doctrine once established
remained an inherent part of the Babylonian-Assyrian religion
and led to the more or less complete disassociation of the three
gods constituting the triad from their original local limitations.
An intermediate step between Anu viewed as the local deity
of Erech (or some other centre), Bel as the god of Nippur, and
Ea as the god of Eridu is represented by the prominence which
each one of the centres associated with the three deities in question
must have acquired, and which led to each one absorbing
the qualities of other gods so as to give them a controlling
position in an organized pantheon. For Nippur we have the
direct evidence that its chief deity, En-lil or Bel, was once
regarded as the head of an extensive pantheon. The sanctity
and, therefore, the importance of Eridu remained a fixed tradition
in the minds of the people to the latest days, and analogy therefore
justifies the conclusion that Anu was likewise worshipped
in a centre which had acquired great prominence. The summing-up
of divine powers manifested in the universe in a threefold
division represents an outcome of speculation in the schools
attached to the temples of Babylonia, but the selection of Anu,
Bel and Ea for the three representatives of the three spheres
recognized, is due to the importance which, for one reason or
the other, the centres in which Anu, Bel and Ea were worshipped
had acquired in the popular mind. Each of the three must have
been regarded in his centre as the most important member in a
larger or smaller group, so that their union in a triad marks also
the combination of the three distinctive pantheons into a
harmonious whole.</p>

<p>In the astral theology of Babylonia and Assyria, Anu, Bel and
Ea became the three zones of the ecliptic, the northern, middle
and southern zone respectively. The purely theoretical character
of Anu is thus still further emphasized, and in the annals and
votive inscriptions as well as in the incantations and hymns, he
is rarely introduced as an active force to whom a personal
appeal can be made. His name becomes little more than a
synonym for the heavens in general and even his title as king
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page157" id="page157"></a>157</span>
or father of the gods has little of the personal element in it. A
consort Antum (or as some scholars prefer to read, Anatum)
is assigned to him, on the theory that every deity must have a
female associate, but Antum is a purely artificial product&mdash;a
lifeless symbol playing even less of a part in what may be called
the active pantheon than Anu.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANUBIS<a name="ar180" id="ar180"></a></span> (in Egyptian <i>An&#363;p</i>, written <i>&#298;npw</i> in hieroglyphs),
the name of one of the most important of the Egyptian gods.
There were two types of canine divinities in Egypt, their leading
representatives being respectively Anubis and Ophois (Wp-w,&rsquo;-wt,
&ldquo;opener of the ways&rdquo;): the former type is symbolized by the
recumbent animal <img style="width:47px; height:33px" src="images/img157a.jpg" alt="" />, the other by a similar animal (in a
stiff standing attitude), carried as an emblem on a standard
<img style="width:42px; height:47px" src="images/img157b.jpg" alt="" /> in war or in religious processions. The former comprised
two beneficent gods of the necropolis; the latter also were
beneficent, but warlike, divinities. They thus corresponded, at
any rate in some measure, respectively to the fiercer and milder
aspects of the dog-tribe. In late days the Greeks report that
<span class="grk" title="kunes">&#954;&#973;&#957;&#949;&#962;</span> (dogs) were the sacred animals of Anubis while those of
Ophois were <span class="grk" title="lykoi">&#955;&#973;&#954;&#959;&#953;</span> (wolves). The above figure <img style="width:43px; height:35px" src="images/img157c.jpg" alt="" /> is coloured
black as befits a funerary and nocturnal animal: it is more
attenuated than even a greyhound, but it has the bushy tail of
the fox or the jackal. Probably these were the original genii of
the necropolis, and in fact the same lean animal figured <i>passant</i>
<img style="width:39px; height:27px" src="images/img157d.jpg" alt="" /> is s,&rsquo;b &ldquo;jackal&rdquo; or &ldquo;fox.&rdquo; The domestic dog would be
brought into the sacred circle through the increased veneration
for animals, and the more pronounced view in later times of
Anubis as servant, messenger and custodian of the gods.</p>

<p>Anubis was the principal god in the capitals of the XVIIth
and XVIIIth nomes of Upper Egypt, and secondary god in the
XIIIth and probably in the XIIth nome; but his cult was
universal. To begin with, he was the god of the dead, of the
cemetery, of all supplies for the dead, and therefore of embalming
when that became customary. In very early inscriptions the
funerary prayers in the tombs are addressed to him almost
exclusively, and he always took a leading place in them. In the
scene of the weighing of the soul before Osiris, dating from the
New kingdom onwards, Anubis attends to the balance while
Thoth registers the result. Anubis was believed to have been
the embalmer of Osiris: the mummy of Osiris, or of the deceased,
on a bier, tended by this god, is a very common subject on
funerary tablets of the late periods. Anubis came to be considered
especially the attendant of the gods and conductor of
the dead, and hence was commonly identified with Hermes
(cf. the name Hermanubis); but the role of Hermes as the god
of eloquence, inventor of arts and recorder of the gods was
taken by Thoth. In those days Anubis was considered to be
son of Osiris by Nephthys; earlier perhaps he was son of Re,
the sun-god. In the 2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> his aid was &ldquo;compelled&rdquo;
by the magicians and necromancers to fetch the gods
and entertain them with food (especially in the ceremony of
gazing into the bowl of oil), and he is invoked by them sometimes
as the &ldquo;Good Ox-herd.&rdquo; The cult of Anubis must at all
times have been very popular in Egypt, and, belonging to the
Isis and Serapis cycle, was introduced into Greece and Rome.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANURADHAPURA,<a name="ar181" id="ar181"></a></span> a ruined city of Ceylon, famous for its
ancient monuments. It is situated in the North-central province.
Anuradhapura became the capital of Ceylon in the 5th century
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and attained its highest magnificence about the commencement
of the Christian era. In its prime it ranked beside Nineveh
and Babylon in its colossal proportions&mdash;its four walls, each 16 m.
long, enclosing an area of 256 sq. m.,&mdash;in the number of its
inhabitants, and the splendour of its shrines and public edifices.
It suffered much during the earlier Tamil invasions, and was
finally deserted as a royal residence in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 769. It fell completely
into decay, and it is only of recent years that the jungle
has been cleared away, the ruins laid bare, and some measure
of prosperity brought back to the surrounding country by the
restoration of hundreds of village tanks. The ruins consist of
three classes of buildings, <i>dagobas</i>, monastic buildings, and
<i>pokunas</i>. The <i>dagobas</i> are bell-shaped masses of masonry,
varying from a few feet to over 1100 in circumference. Some
of them contain enough masonry to build a town for twenty-five
thousand inhabitants. Remains of the monastic buildings are
to be found in every direction in the shape of raised stone platforms,
foundations and stone pillars. The most famous is the
Brazen Palace erected by King Datagamana about 164 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
The <i>pokunas</i> are bathing-tanks or tanks for the supply of
drinking-water, which are scattered everywhere through the
jungle. The city also contains a sacred Bo-tree, which is said to
date back to the year 245 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> The railway was extended from
Matale to Anuradhapura in 1905. Population: town, 3672;
province, 79,110.</p>

which something is &ldquo;welded&rdquo; or &ldquo;folded,&rdquo; cf. German <i>falzen</i>,
to fold, or connected with other Teutonic forms of the word,
cf. German <i>amboss</i>, in which case the final syllable is from
&ldquo;beat,&rdquo; and the meaning is &ldquo;that on which something is
beaten&rdquo;), a mass of iron on which material is supported while
being shaped under the hammer (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Forging</a></span>). The common
blacksmith&rsquo;s anvil is made of wrought iron, often in America
of cast iron, with a smooth working face of hardened steel.
It has at one end a projecting conical <i>beak</i> or <i>bick</i> for use in
hammering curved pieces of metal; occasionally the other end
is also provided with a bick, which is then partly rectangular in
section. There is also a square hole in the face, into which tools,
such as the anvil-cutter or chisel, can be dropped, cutting edge
uppermost. For power hammers the anvil proper is supported
on an anvil block which is of great massiveness, sometimes
weighing over 200 tons for a 12-ton hammer, and this again
rests on a strong foundation of timber and masonry or concrete.
In anatomy the term anvil is applied to one of the bones of the
middle ear, the <i>incus</i>, which is articulated with the <i>malleus</i>.</p>

<p><span class="bold">ANVILLE, JEAN BAPTISTE BOURGUIGNON D&rsquo;<a name="ar183" id="ar183"></a></span> (1697-1782),
perhaps the greatest geographical author of the 18th
century, was born at Paris on the 11th of July 1697. His passion
for geographical research displayed itself from early years: at
the age of twelve he was already amusing himself by drawing
maps for Latin authors. Later, his friendship with the antiquarian,
Abbé Longuerue, greatly aided his studies. His first
serious map, that of Ancient Greece, was published when he
was fifteen, and at the age of twenty-two he was appointed one
of the king&rsquo;s geographers, and began to attract the attention of
the first authorities. D&rsquo;Anville&rsquo;s studies embraced everything
of geographical nature in the world&rsquo;s literature, as far as he could
master it: for this purpose he not only searched ancient and
modern historians, travellers and narrators of every description,
but also poets, orators and philosophers. One of his cherished
objects was to reform geography by putting an end to the blind
copying of older maps, by testing the commonly accepted positions
of places through a rigorous examination of all the descriptive
authority, and by excluding from cartography every name
inadequately supported. Vast spaces, which had before been
covered with countries and cities, were thus suddenly reduced
almost to a blank.</p>

<p>D&rsquo;Anville was at first employed in the humbler task of illustrating
by maps the works of different travellers, such as Marchais,
Charlevoix, Labat and Duhalde. For the history of China by
the last-named writer he was employed to make an atlas, which
was published separately at the Hague in 1737. In 1735 and 1736
he brought out two treatises on the figure of the earth; but
these attempts to solve geometrical problems by literary material
were, to a great extent, refuted by Maupertuis&rsquo; measurements
of a degree within the polar circle. D&rsquo;Anville&rsquo;s historical method
was more successful in his 1743 map of Italy, which first indicated
numerous errors in the mapping of that country, and was accompanied
by a valuable memoir (a novelty in such work), showing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page158" id="page158"></a>158</span>
in full the sources of the design. A trigonometrical survey which
Benedict XIV. soon after had made in the papal states strikingly
confirmed the French geographer&rsquo;s results. In his later years
d&rsquo;Anville did yeoman service for ancient and medieval geography,
accomplishing something like a revolution in the former;
mapping afresh all the chief countries of the pre-Christian
civilizations (especially Egypt), and by his <i>Mémoire et abrégé
de géographie ancienne et générale</i> and his <i>États formés en Europe
après la chute de l&rsquo;empire romain en occident</i> (1771) rendering his
labours still more generally useful. In 1754, at the age of fifty-seven,
he became a member of the Académie des Inscriptions et
Belles Lettres, whose transactions he enriched with many papers.
In 1775 he received the only place in the Académie des Sciences
which is allotted to geography; and in the same year he was
appointed, without solicitation, first geographer to the king.
His last employment consisted in arranging his collection of
maps, plans and geographical materials. It was the most
extensive in Europe, and had been purchased by the king, who,
however, left him the use of it during his life. This task performed,
he sank into a total imbecility both of mind and body,
which continued for two years, till his death in January 1782.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>D&rsquo;Anville&rsquo;s published memoirs and dissertations amounted to
78, and his maps to 211. A complete edition of his works was announced
in 1806 by de Manne in 6 vols. quarto, only two of which
had appeared when the editor died in 1832. See Dacier&rsquo;s <i>Éloge de
d&rsquo;Anville</i> (Paris, 1802). Besides the separate works noticed above,
d&rsquo;Anville&rsquo;s maps executed for Rollin&rsquo;s <i>Histoire ancienne</i> and <i>Histoire
romaine</i>, and his <i>Traité des mesures anciennes et modernes</i> (1769),

<p><span class="bold">ANWARI<a name="ar184" id="ar184"></a></span> [Auhad-uddin Ali Anwari], Persian poet, was born
in Khorasan early in the 12th century. He enjoyed the especial
favour of the sultan Sinjar, whom he attended in all his warlike
expeditions. On one occasion, when the sultan was besieging
the fortress of Hazarasp, a fierce poetical conflict was maintained
between Anwari and his rival Rashidi, who was within the
beleaguered castle, by means of verses fastened to arrows.
Anwari died at Balkh towards the end of the 12th century. The
<i>Diwan</i>, or collection of his poems, consists of a series of long
poems, and a number of simpler lyrics. His longest piece, <i>The

<p><span class="bold">ANZENGRUBER, LUDWIG<a name="ar186" id="ar186"></a></span> (1839-1889), Austrian dramatist
and novelist, was born at Vienna on the 29th of November 1839.
He was educated at the <i>Realschule</i> of his native town, and then
entered a bookseller&rsquo;s shop; from 1860 to 1867 he was an actor,
without, however, displaying any marked talent, although
his stage experience later stood him in good stead. In 1869 he
became a clerk in the Viennese police department, but having
in the following year made a success with his anti-clerical drama,
<i>Der Pfarrer von Kirchfeld</i>, he gave up his appointment and
devoted himself entirely to literature. He died at Vienna on
the both of December 1889. Anzengruber was exceedingly
fertile in ideas, and wrote a great many plays. They are mostly
of Austrian peasant life, and although somewhat melancholy in
tone are interspersed with bright and witty scenes. Among the
best known are <i>Der Meineidbauer</i> (1871), <i>Die Kreuzelschreiber</i>
(1872), <i>Der G&rsquo;wissenswurm</i> (1874), <i>Hand und Herz</i> (1875),
<i>Doppelselbstmord</i> (1875), <i>Das vierte Gebot</i> (1877), and <i>Der Fleck
auf der Ehr&rsquo;</i> (1889). Anzengruber also published a novel of
considerable merit, <i>Der Schandfleck</i> (1876; remodelled 1884);
and various short stories and tales of village life collected under
the title <i>Wolken und Sunn&rsquo;schein</i> (1888).</p>

river. Pop. (1890) 2727; (1900) 3077, of whom 1589 were of
negro descent; (1905, state census) 3244. It is served by the
Apalachicola Northern railway (to Chattahoochee, Florida),
and by river steamers which afford connexion with railways
at Carrabelle about 25 m. distant, at Chatahoochee (or River
Junction), and at Columbus and Bainbridge, Georgia, and by
ocean-going vessels with American and foreign ports. The city
has a monument (1900) to John Gorrie (1803-1855), a physician
who discovered the cold-air process of refrigeration in 1849 (and
patented an ice-machine in 1850), as the result of experiments
to lower the temperatures of fever patients. The bay is well
protected by St Vincent, Flag, Sand, and St George&rsquo;s islands;
and the shipping of lumber, naval stores and cotton, which
reach the city by way of the river, forms the principal industry.
Before the development of railways in the Gulf states, Apalachicola
was one of the principal centres of trade in the southern
states, ranking third among the Gulf ports in 1835. In 1907 the
Federal government projected a channel across the harbour bar
100 ft. wide and 10 ft. deep and a channel 150 ft. wide and 18 ft.
deep for Link Channel and the West Pass. In 1907 the exports
were valued at $317,838; the imports were insignificant. The
value of the total domestic and foreign commerce of the port
for the year ending on the 30th of June 1907 was estimated
at $1,240,000 (76,000 tons). The fishery products, including
oysters, tarpon, sturgeon, caviare and sponges, are also important.</p>

<p>2. A city in Phrygia, founded by Antiochus Soter (from whose
mother, Apama, it received its name), near, but on lower ground
than, Celaenae. It was situated where the Marsyas leaves the
hills to join the Maeander, and it became a seat of Seleucid
power, and a centre of Graeco-Roman and Graeco-Hebrew
civilization and commerce. There Antiochus the Great collected
the army with which he met the Romans at Magnesia, and there
two years later the treaty between Rome and the Seleucid
realm was signed. After Antiochus&rsquo; departure for the East,
Apamea lapsed to the Pergamenian kingdom and thence to
Rome in 133, but it was resold to Mithradates V., who held it
till 120. After the Mithradatic wars it became and remained a
great centre for trade, largely carried on by resident Italians
and by Jews. In 84 Sulla made it the seat of a <i>conventus</i> of the
Asian province, and it long claimed primacy among Phrygian
cities. Its decline dates from the local disorganization of the
empire in the 3rd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>; and though a bishopric, it was
not an important military or commercial centre in Byzantine
times. The Turks took it first in 1070, and from the 13th
century onwards it was always in Moslem hands. For a long
period it was one of the greatest cities of Asia Minor, commanding
the Maeander road; but when the trade routes were diverted
to Constantinople it rapidly declined, and its ruin was completed
by an earthquake. A Jewish tradition, possibly arising from
a name <i>Cibotus</i> (ark), which the town bore, identified a neighbouring
mountain with Ararat. The famous &ldquo;Noah&rdquo; coins of
the emperor Philip commemorate this belief. The site is now
partly occupied by <i>Dineir</i> (<i>q.v.</i>, sometimes locally known also
as <i>Geiklar</i>, &ldquo;the gazelles,&rdquo; perhaps from a tradition of the
Persian hunting-park, seen by Xenophon at Celaenae), which is

<p><span class="bold">APATITE,<a name="ar196" id="ar196"></a></span> a widely distributed mineral, which, when found
in large masses, is of considerable economic value as a phosphate.
As a mineral species it was first recognized by A.G. Werner in
1786 and named by him from the Greek <span class="grk" title="apatan">&#7936;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#8118;&#957;</span>, to deceive,
because it had previously been mistaken for other minerals,
such as beryl, tourmaline, chrysolite, amethyst, &amp;c. Although
long known to consist mainly of calcium phosphate, it was not
until 1827 that G. Rose found that fluorine or chlorine is an
essential constituent. Two chemical varieties of apatite are to
be distinguished, namely a fluor-apatite, (CaF)Ca<span class="su">4</span>P<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">12</span>, and a
chlor-apatite, (CaCl)Ca<span class="su">4</span>P<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">12</span>: the former, which is much the
commoner, contains 42.3% of phosphorus pentoxide (P<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">5</span>)
and 3.8% fluorine, and the latter 4.10 P<span class="su">2</span>O<span class="su">5</span> and 6.8%
chlorine. Fluorine and chlorine replace each other in indefinite
proportions, and they may also be in part replaced by hydroxyl,
so that the general formula becomes [Ca (F, Cl, OH)] Ca<span class="su">4</span>P<span class="su">3</span>O<span class="su">12</span>,
in which the univalent group Ca(F, Cl, OH) takes the place
of one hydrogen atom in orthophosphoric acid H<span class="su">3</span>PO<span class="su">4</span>. The
formula is sometimes written in the form 3Ca<span class="su">3</span>(PO<span class="su">4</span>)<span class="su">2</span> + CaF<span class="su">2</span>.
Mangan-apatite is a variety in which calcium is largely replaced
by manganese (up to 10% MnO). Cerium, didymium, yttrium,
&amp;c., oxides may also sometimes be present, in amounts up to 5%.</p>

<p>Apatite frequently occurs as beautifully developed crystals,
sometimes a foot or more in length, belonging to that division
of the hexagonal system in which there is pyramidal hemi-hedrism.
In this type of symmetry, of which apatite is the best
example, there is only one plane of symmetry, which is perpendicular
to the hexad axis. The arrangement of the pyramidal
faces <i>n</i> and <i>u</i> in fig. 2 show the hemihedral character and absence
of the full number of planes and axes of symmetry. Fig. 2
represents a highly modified crystal from St Gotthard; a more
common form is shown in fig. 1, which is bounded by the hexagonal
prism <i>m</i>, hexagonal bipyramid <i>x</i> and basal pinacoid <i>c</i>.</p>

<p>In its general appearance, apatite exhibits wide variations.
Crystals may be colourless and transparent or white and opaque,
but are often coloured, usually some shade of green or brown,
occasionally violet, sky-blue, yellow, &amp;c. The lustre is vitreous,
inclining to sub-resinous. There is an imperfect cleavage
parallel to the basal pinacoid, and the fracture is conchoidal.
Hardness 5, specific gravity 3.2.</p>

<p>Yellowish-green prismatic crystals from Jumilla in Murcia in
Spain have long been known under the name asparagus-stone.
Lazurapatite is a sky-blue variety found as crystals with lapis-lazuli
in Siberia; and moroxite is the name given to dull greenish-blue
crystals from Norway and Canada. Francolite, from Wheal
Franco, near Tavistock in Devonshire, and also from several
Cornish mines, occurs as crystallized stalactitic masses. In
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page160" id="page160"></a>160</span>
addition to these crystallized varieties, there are massive varieties,
fibrous, concretionary, stalactitic, or earthy in form, which are
included together under the name phosphorite (<i>q.v.</i>), and it is
these massive varieties, together with various rock-phosphates
(phosphatic nodules, coprolites, guano, &amp;c.) which are of such
great economic importance: crystallized apatite is mined for
phosphates only in Norway and Canada.</p>

<p>With regard to its mode of occurrence, apatite is found under
a variety of conditions. In igneous rocks of all kinds it is invariably
present in small amounts as minute acicular crystals,
and was one of the first constituents of the rock to crystallize
out from the magma. The extensive deposits of chlor-apatite
near Kragerö and Bamle, near Brevik, in southern Norway, are
in connexion with gabbro, the felspar of which has been altered,
by emanations containing chlorine, to scapolite, and titanium
minerals have been developed. The apatite occurring in connexion
with granite and veins of tin-stone is, on the other hand,
a fluor-apatite, and, like the other fluorine-bearing minerals
characteristic of tin-veins, doubtless owes its origin to the
emanations of tin fluoride which gave rise to the tin-ore. Special
mention may be here made of the beautiful violet crystals of
fluor-apatite which occur in the veins of tin-ore in the Erzgebirge,
and of the brilliant bluish-green crystals encrusting
cavities in the granite of Luxullian in Cornwall. Another
common mode of occurrence of apatite is in metamorphic
crystalline rocks, especially in crystalline limestones: in eastern
Canada extensive beds of apatite occur in the limestones associated
with the Laurentian gneisses. Still another mode of occurrence
is presented by beautifully developed and transparent
crystals found with crystals of felspar and quartz lining the
crevices in the gneiss of the Alps. Crystallized apatite is also
occasionally found in metalliferous veins, other than those of
tin, and in beds of iron ore; whilst if the massive varieties
(phosphorite) be considered many other modes of occurrence
might be cited.</p>

annually by all the Ionian towns except Ephesus and Colophon
(Herodotus i. 147). At Athens it took place in the month of
Pyanepsion (October to November), and lasted three days, on
which occasion the various phratries (<i>i.e.</i> clans) of Attica met
to discuss their affairs. The name is a slightly modified form of
<span class="grk" title="apatoria = hamapatoria, homopatoria">&#7936;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#972;&#961;&#953;&#945; = &#7936;&#956;&#945;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#972;&#961;&#953;&#945;, &#8001;&#956;&#959;&#960;&#945;&#964;&#972;&#961;&#953;&#945;</span>, the festival of &ldquo;common
relationship.&rdquo; The ancient etymology associated it with <span class="grk" title="apatê">&#7936;&#960;&#940;&#964;&#951;</span>
(deceit), a legend existing that the festival originated in 1100 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
in commemoration of a single combat between a certain Melanthus,
representing King Thymoetes of Attica, and King Xanthus
of Boeotia, in which Melanthus successfully threw his adversary
off his guard by crying that a man in a black goat&rsquo;s skin
(identified with Dionysus) was helping him (Schol. Aristophanes,
<i>Acharnians</i>, 146). On the first day of the festival, called Dorpia
or Dorpeia, banquets were held towards evening at the meeting-place
of the phratries or in the private houses of members. On
the second, Anarrhysis (from <span class="grk" title="anarruein">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#961;&#961;&#973;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to draw back the
victim&rsquo;s head), a sacrifice of oxen was offered at the public cost
to Zeus Phratrius and Athena. On the third day, Cureotis
(<span class="grk" title="koureotis">&#954;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#949;&#8182;&#964;&#953;&#962;</span>), children born since the last festival were presented
by their fathers or guardians to the assembled phratores, and,
after an oath had been taken as to their legitimacy and the
sacrifice of a goat or a sheep, their names were inscribed in the
register. The name <span class="grk" title="koureotis">&#954;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#949;&#8182;&#964;&#953;&#962;</span> is derived either from <span class="grk" title="kouros">&#954;&#959;&#8166;&#961;&#959;&#962;</span>,
that is, the day of the young, or less probably from <span class="grk" title="keiro">&#954;&#949;&#943;&#961;&#969;</span>,
because on this occasion young people cut their hair and offered
it to the gods. The victim was called <span class="grk" title="meion">&#956;&#949;&#8150;&#959;&#957;</span>. On this day also
it was the custom for boys still at school to declaim pieces of
poetry, and to receive prizes (Plato, <i>Timaeus</i>, 21 B). According
to Hesychius these three days of the festival were followed by a
fourth, called <span class="grk" title="epibda">&#7952;&#960;&#943;&#946;&#948;&#945;</span>, but this is merely a general term for the
day after any festival.</p>

<hr class="art" />
<p><span class="bold">APELLA,<a name="ar200" id="ar200"></a></span> the official title of the popular assembly at Sparta,
corresponding to the ecclesia in most other Greek states. Every
full citizen who had completed his thirtieth year was entitled to
attend the meetings, which, according to Lycurgus&rsquo;s ordinance,
must be held at the time of each full moon within the boundaries
of Sparta. They had in all probability taken place originally
in the Agora, but were later transferred to the neighbouring
building known as the Skias (Paus. iii. 12. 10). The presiding
officers were at first the kings, but in historical times the ephors,
and the voting was conducted by shouts; if the president was
doubtful as to the majority of voices, a division was taken and
the votes were counted. Lycurgus had ordained that the apella
must simply accept or reject the proposals submitted to it,
and though this regulation fell into neglect, it was practically
restored by the law of Theopompus and Polydorus which empowered
the kings and elders to set aside any &ldquo;crooked&rdquo;
decision of the people (Plut. <i>Lycurg.</i> 6). In later times, too, the
actual debate was almost, if not wholly, confined to the kings,
elders, ephors and perhaps the other magistrates. The apella
voted on peace and war, treaties and foreign policy in general:
it decided which of the kings should conduct a campaign and
settled questions of disputed succession to the throne: it elected
elders, ephors and other magistrates, emancipated helots and
perhaps voted on legal proposals. There is a single reference
(Xen. <i>Hell.</i> iii. 3. 8) to a &ldquo;small assembly&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="ê mikra

its nature or competence. The term apella does not occur in
extant Spartan inscriptions, though two decrees of Gythium

<p><span class="bold">APELLES,<a name="ar201" id="ar201"></a></span> probably the greatest painter of antiquity. He
lived from the time of Philip of Macedon till after the death of
Alexander. He was of Ionian origin, but after he had attained
some celebrity he became a student at the celebrated school of
Sicyon, where he worked under Pamphilus. He thus combined
the Dorian thoroughness with the Ionic grace. Attracted to
the court of Philip, he painted him and the young Alexander
with such success that he became the recognized court painter
of Macedon, and his picture of Alexander holding a thunderbolt
ranked with the Alexander with the spear of the sculptor
Lysippus. Other works of Apelles had a great reputation in
antiquity, such as the portraits of the Macedonians Clitus,
Archelaus and Antigonus, the procession of the high priest of
Artemis at Ephesus, Artemis amid a chorus of maidens, a great
allegorical picture representing Calumny, and the noted painting
representing Aphrodite rising out of the sea. Of none
of these works have we any copy, unless indeed we may
consider a painting of Alexander as Zeus in the house of the
Vettii at Pompeii as a reminiscence of his work; but some of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>161</span>
the Italian artists of the Renaissance repeated the subjects, in
a vain hope of giving some notion of the composition of them.</p>

<p>Few things are more hopeless than the attempt to realize
the style of a painter whose works have vanished. But a great
wealth of stories, true or invented, clung to Apelles in antiquity;
and modern archaeologists have naturally tried to discover what
they indicate. We are told, for example, that he attached great
value to the drawing of outlines, practising every day. The tale
is well known of his visit to Protogenes, and the rivalry of the
two masters as to which could draw the finest and steadiest line.
The power of drawing such lines is conspicuous in the decoration
of red-figured vases of Athens. Apelles is said to have treated
his rival with generosity, for he increased the value of his pictures
by spreading a report that he meant to buy them and sell them
as his own. Apelles allowed the superiority of some of his
contemporaries in particular matters: according to Pliny he
admired the <i>dispositio</i> of Melanthius, <i>i.e.</i> the way in which he
spaced his figures, and the <i>mensurae</i> of Asclepiodorus, who
must have been a great master of symmetry and proportion.
It was especially in that undefinable quality &ldquo;grace&rdquo; that
Apelles excelled. He probably used but a small variety of
colours, and avoided elaborate perspective: simplicity of
design, beauty of line and charm of expression were his chief
merits. When the naturalism of some of his works is praised&mdash;
for example, the hand of his Alexander is said to have stood out
from the picture&mdash;we must remember that this is the merit
always ascribed by ignorant critics to works which they admire.
In fact the age of Alexander was one of notable idealism, and
probably Apelles succeeded in a marked degree in imparting to
his figures a beauty beyond nature.</p>

<p>Apelles was also noted for improvements which he introduced
in technique. He had a dark glaze, called by Pliny <i>atramentum</i>,
which served both to preserve his paintings and to soften their
colour. There can be little doubt that he was one of the most
bold and progressive, of artists.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APELLICON,<a name="ar202" id="ar202"></a></span> a wealthy native of Teos, afterwards an Athenian
citizen, a famous book collector. He not only spent large sums
in the acquisition of his library, but stole original documents
from the archives of Athens and other cities of Greece. Being
detected, he fled in order to escape punishment, but returned
when Athenion (or Aristion), a bitter opponent of the Romans,
had made himself tyrant of the city with the aid of Mithradates.
Athenion sent him with some troops to Delos, to plunder the
treasures of the temple, but he showed little military capacity.
He was surprised by the Romans under the command of Orobius
(or Orbius), and only saved his life by flight. He died a little
later, probably in 84 <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

<p>Apellicon&rsquo;s chief pursuit was the collection of rare and important
books. He purchased from the family of Neleus of Skepsis
in the Troad manuscripts of the works of Aristotle and Theophrastus
(including their libraries), which had been given to
Neleus by Theophrastus himself, whose pupil Neleus had been.
They had been concealed in a cellar to prevent their falling into the
hands of the book-collecting princes of Pergamum, and were in
a very dilapidated condition. Apellicon filled in the lacunae, and
brought out a new, but faulty, edition. In 84 Sulla removed
Apellicon&rsquo;s library to Rome (Strabo xiii. p. 609; Plutarch,
<i>Sulla</i>, 26). Here the MSS. were handed over to the grammarian
Tyrannion, who took copies of them, on the basis of which the
peripatetic philosopher Andronicus of Rhodes prepared an
edition of Aristotle&rsquo;s works. Apellicon&rsquo;s library contained a
remarkable old copy of the <i>Iliad</i>. He is said to have published
a biography of Aristotle, in which the calumnies of other biographers
were refuted.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APENNINES<a name="ar203" id="ar203"></a></span> (Gr. <span class="grk" title="Apenninos">&#902;&#960;&#941;&#957;&#957;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>, Lat. <i>Appenninus</i>&mdash;in both
cases used in the singular), a range of mountains traversing
the entire peninsula of Italy, and forming, as it were, the
backbone of the country. The name is probably derived from
the Celtic <i>pen</i>, a mountain top: it originally belonged to the
northern portion of the chain, from the Maritime Alps to Ancona;
and Polybius is probably the first writer who applied it to the
whole chain, making, indeed, no distinction between the
Apennines and the Maritime Alps, and extending the former
name as far as Marseilles. Classical authors do not differentiate
the various parts of the chain, but use the name as a general
name for the whole. The total length is some 800 m. and the
maximum width 70 to 80 m.</p>

<p><i>Divisions.</i>&mdash;Modern geographers divide the range into three
parts, northern, central and southern.</p>

<p>1. The northern Apennines are generally distinguished (though
there is no real solution of continuity) from the Maritime Alps
at the Bocchetta dell&rsquo; Altare, some 5 m. W. of Savona on the
high road to Turin.<a name="fa1h" id="fa1h" href="#ft1h"><span class="sp">1</span></a> They again are divided into three parts&mdash;
the Ligurian, Tuscan and Umbrian Apennines. The Ligurian
Apennines extend as far as the pass of La Cisa in the upper
valley of the Magra (anc. <i>Macra</i>) above Spezia; at first they
follow the curve of the Gulf of Genoa, and then run east-south-east
parallel to the coast. On the north and north-east lie the broad
plains of Piedmont and Lombardy, traversed by the Po, the
chief tributaries of which from the Ligurian Apennines are the
Scrivia (<i>Olumbria</i>), Trebbia (<i>Trebia</i>) and Taro (<i>Tarus</i>). The Tanaro
(<i>Tanarus</i>), though largely fed by tributaries from the Ligurian
Apennines, itself rises in the Maritime Alps, while the rivers
on the south and south-west of the range are short and unimportant.
The south side of the range rises steeply from the
sea, leaving practically no coast strip: its slopes are sheltered
and therefore fertile and highly cultivated, and the coast towns
are favourite winter resorts (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Riviera</a></span>). The highest point
(the Monte Bue) reaches 5915 ft. The range is crossed by several
railways&mdash;the line from Savona to Turin (with a branch at Ceva
for Acqui), that from Genoa to Ovada and Acqui, the main lines
from Genoa to Novi, the junction for Turin and Milan (both
of which<a name="fa2h" id="fa2h" href="#ft2h"><span class="sp">2</span></a> pass under the Monte dei Giovi, the ancient Mons
loventius, by which the ancient Via Postumia ran from Genua
to Dertona), and that from Spezia to Parma under the pass of
La Cisa.<a name="fa3h" id="fa3h" href="#ft3h"><span class="sp">3</span></a> All these traverse the ridge by long tunnels&mdash;that on
the new line from Genoa to Honco is upwards of 5 m. in length.</p>

<p>The Tuscan Apennines extend from the pass of La Cisa to the
sources of the Tiber. The main chain continues to run in an
east-south-east direction, but traverses the peninsula, the west
coast meanwhile turning almost due south. From the northern
slopes many rivers and streams run north and north-north-east
into the Po, the Secchia (<i>Secia</i>) and Panaro (<i>Scultenna</i>) being
among the most important, while farther east most of the rivers
are tributaries of the Reno (anc. <i>Rhenus</i>). Other small streams,
<i>e.g.</i> the Ronco (<i>Bedesis</i>) and Montone (<i>Utis</i>), which flow into the
sea together east of Ravenna, were also tributaries of the Po;
and the Savio (<i>Sapis</i>) and the Rubicon seem to be the only
streams from this side of the Tuscan Apennines that ran directly
into the sea in Roman days. From the south-west side of the
main range the Arno (<i>q.v.</i>) and Serchio run into the Mediterranean.
This section of the Apennines is crossed by two railways, from
Pistoia to Bologna and from Florence to Faenza, and by several
good high roads, of which the direct road from Florence to
Bologna over the Futa pass is of Roman origin; and certain
places in it are favourite summer resorts. The highest point of
the chain is Monte Cimone (7103 ft.). The so-called Alpi Apuane
(the <i>Apuani</i> were an ancient people of Liguria), a detached chain
south-west of the valley of the Serchio, rise to a maximum height
of 6100 ft. They contain the famous marble quarries of Carrara.
The greater part of Tuscany, however, is taken up by lower hills,
which form no part of the Apennines, being divided from the
main chain by the valleys of the Arno, Chiana (<i>Clanis</i>) and
Paglia (<i>Pallia</i>), Towards the west they are rich in minerals and
chemicals, which the Apennines proper do not produce.</p>

<p>The Umbrian Apennines extend from the sources of the Tiber
to (or perhaps rather beyond) the pass of Scheggia near Cagli,
where the ancient Via Flaminia crosses the range. The highest
point is the Monte Nerone (5010 ft.). The chief river is the Tiber
itself: the others, among which the Foglia (<i>Pisaurus</i>), Metauro
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page162" id="page162"></a>162</span>
(<i>Metaurus</i>) and Esino<a name="fa4h" id="fa4h" href="#ft4h"><span class="sp">4</span></a> may be mentioned, run north-east into
the Adriatic, which is some 30 m. from the highest points of the
chain. This portion of the range is crossed near its southern
termination by a railway from Foligno to Ancona (which at
Fabriano has a branch to Macerata and Porto Civitanova, on
the Adriatic coast railway), which may perhaps be conveniently
regarded as its boundary.<a name="fa5h" id="fa5h" href="#ft5h"><span class="sp">5</span></a> By some geographers, indeed, it is
treated as a part of the central Apennines.</p>

<p>2. The central Apennines are the most extensive portion of
the chain, and stretch as far as the valley of the Sangro (<i>Sangrus</i>).
To the north are the Monti Sibillini, the highest point of which
is the Monte Vettore (8128 ft.). Farther south three parallel
chains may be traced, the westernmost of which (the Monti
Sabini) culminates to the south in the Monte Viglio (7075 ft.),
the central chain in the Monte Terminillo (7260 ft.), and farther
south in the Monte Velino (8160 ft.), and the eastern in the
Gran Sasso d&rsquo;Italia (9560 ft.), the highest summit of the Apennines,
and the Maiella group (Monte Amaro, 9170 ft.). Between
the western and central ranges are the plain of Rieti, the valley
of the Salto (<i>Himella</i>), and the Lago Fucino; while between the
central and eastern ranges are the valleys of Aquila and Sulmona.
The chief rivers on the west are the Nera (<i>Nar</i>), with its tributaries
the Velino (<i>Velinus</i>) and Salto, and the Anio, both of which
fall into the Tiber. On the east there is at first a succession of
small rivers which flow into the Adriatic, from which the highest
points of the chain are some 25 m. distant, such as the Potenza
(<i>Flosis</i>), Chienti (<i>Cluentus</i>), Tenna (<i>Tinna</i>), Tronto (<i>Truentus</i>),
Tordino (<i>Helvinus</i>), Vomano (<i>Vomanus</i>), &amp;c. The Pescara
(<i>Aternus</i>), which receives the Aterno from the north-west and
the Gizio from the south-east, is more important; and so is the
Sangro.</p>

<p>The central Apennines are crossed by the railway from Rome
to Castelammare Adriatico via Avezzano and Sulmona: the
railway from Orte to Terni (and thence to Foligno) follows the
Nera valley; while from Terni a line ascends to the plain of
Rieti, and thence crosses the central chain to Aquila, whence it
follows the valley of the Aterno to Sulmona. In ancient times
the Via Salaria, Via Caecilia and Via Valeria-Claudia all ran
from Rome to the Adriatic coast. The volcanic mountains of
the province of Rome are separated from the Apennines by the
Tiber valley, and the Monti Lepini, or Volscian mountains, by
the valleys of the Sacco and Liri.</p>

<p>3. In the southern Apennines, to the south of the Sangro
valley, the three parallel chains are broken up into smaller
groups; among them may be named the Matese, the highest
point of which is the Monte Miletto (6725 ft.). The chief rivers
on the south-west are the Liri or Garigliano (anc. <i>Liris</i>) with its
tributary the Sacco (<i>Trerus</i>), the Volturno (<i>Volturnus</i>), Sebeto
(<i>Sabatus</i>), Sarno (<i>Sarnus</i>), on the north the Trigno (<i>Trinius</i>),
Biferno (<i>Tifernus</i>), and Fortore (<i>Frento</i>). The promontory of
Monte Gargano, on the east, is completely isolated, and so are the
volcanic groups near Naples. The district is traversed from
north-west to south-east by the railway from Sulmona to
Benevento and on to Avellino, and from south-west to north-east
by the railways from Caianello via Isernia to Campobasso
and Termoli, from Caserta to Benevento and Foggia, and from
Nocera and Avellino to Rocchetta S. Antonio, the junction for
Foggia, Spinazzola (for Barletta, Bari, and Taranto) and Potenza.
Roman roads followed the same lines as the railways: the Via
Appia ran from Capua to Benevento, whence the older road
went to Venosa and Taranto and so to Brindisi, while the Via
Traiana ran nearly to Foggia and thence to Bari.</p>

<p>The valley of the Ofanto (<i>Aufidus</i>), which runs into the
Adriatic close to Barletta, marks the northern termination of
the first range of the Lucanian Apennines (now Basilicata),
which runs from east to west, while south of the valleys of the
Sele (on the west) and Basiento (on the east)-which form the
line followed by the railway from Battipaglia via Potenza to
Metaponto&mdash;the second range begins to run due north and
south as far as the plain of Sibari (<i>Sybaris</i>). The highest point
is the Monte Pollino (7325 ft.). The chief rivers are the Sele
(<i>Silarus</i>)&mdash;joined by the Negro (<i>Tanager</i>) and Calore (<i>Calor</i>)&mdash;
on the west, and the Bradano (<i>Bradanus</i>), Basiento (<i>Casuentus</i>),
Agri (<i>Aciris</i>), Sinni (<i>Siris</i>) on the east, which flow into the gulf
of Taranto; to the south of the last-named river there are
only unimportant streams flowing into the sea east and west,
inasmuch as here the width of the peninsula diminishes to some
40 m. The railway running south from Sicignano to Lagonegro,
ascending the valley of the Negro, is planned to extend to
Cosenza, along the line followed by the ancient Via Popilia,
which beyond Cosenza reached the west coast at Terina and
thence followed it to Reggio. The Via Herculia, a branch of
the Via Traiana, ran from Aequum Tuticum to the ancient
Nerulum. At the narrowest point the plain of Sibari, through
which the rivers Coscile (<i>Sybaris</i>) and Crati (<i>Crathis</i>) flow to
the sea, occurs on the east coast, extending halfway across the
peninsula. Here the limestone Apennines proper cease and the
granite mountains of Calabria (anc. <i>Bruttii</i>) begin. The first
group extends as far as the isthmus formed by the gulfs of S.
Eufemia and Squillace; it is known as the Sila, and the highest
point reached is 6330 ft. (the Botte Donato). The forests which
covered it in ancient times supplied the Greeks and Sicilians
with timber for shipbuilding. The railway from S. Eufemia to
Catanzaro and Catanzaro Marina crosses the isthmus, and an
ancient road may have run from Squillace to Monteleone. The
second group extends to the south end of the Italian peninsula,
culminating in the Aspromonte (6420 ft.) to the east of Reggio
di Calabria. In both groups the rivers are quite unimportant.</p>

<p><i>Character</i>.-The Apennines are to some extent clothed with
forests, though these were probably more extensive in classical
times (Pliny mentions especially pine, oak and beech woods,
<i>Hist. Nat</i>. xvi. 177); they have indeed been greatly reduced in
comparatively modern times by indiscriminate timber-felling,
and though serious attempts at reafforestation have been made
by the government, much remains to be done. They also furnish
considerable summer pastures, especially in the Abruzzi: Pliny
(<i>Hist. Nat</i>. xi. 240) praises the cheese of the Apennines. In the
forests wolves were frequent, and still are found, the flocks being
protected against them by large sheep-dogs; bears, however,
which were known in Roman times, have almost entirely disappeared.
Nor are the wild goats called <i>rotae</i>, spoken of by
Varro (<i>R. R.</i> II. i. 5), which may have been either chamois
or steinbock, to be found. Brigandage appears to have been
prevalent in Roman times in the remoter parts of the Apennines,
as it was until recently: an inscription found near the Furlo
pass was set up in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 246 by an <i>evocatus Augusti</i> (a member
of a picked corps) on special police duty with a detachment of
twenty men from the Ravenna fleet (G. Henzen in <i>Römische
Mitteilungen</i>, 1887, 14). Snow lies on the highest peaks of the
Apennines for almost the whole year. The range produces no
minerals, but there are a considerable number of good mineral
springs, some of which are thermal (such as Bagni di Lucca,
Monte Catini, Monsummano, Porretta, Telese, &amp;c.), while others
are cool (such as Nocera, Sangemini, Cinciano, &amp;c.), the water
of which is both drunk on the spot and sold as table water
elsewhere.</p>
<div class="author">(T. As.)</div>

<p><i>Geology</i>.&mdash;The Apennines are the continuation of the Alpine
chain, but the individual zones of the Alps cannot be traced into
the Apennines. The zone of the Brianconnais (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Alps</a></span>) may
be followed as far as the Gulf of Genoa, but scarcely beyond,
unless it is represented by the Trias and older beds of the Apuan
Alps. The inner zone of crystalline and schistose rocks which
forms the main chain of the Alps, is absent in the Apennines
except towards the southern end. The Apennines, indeed,
consist almost entirely of Mesozoic and Tertiary beds, like the
outer zones of the Alps. Remnants of a former inner zone of
more ancient rocks may be seen in the Apuan Alps, in the islands
off the Tuscan coast; in the Catena Metallifera, Cape Circeo and
the island of Zannone, as well as in the Calabrian peninsula.
These remnants lie at a comparatively low level, and excepting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page163" id="page163"></a>163</span>
the Apuan Alps and the Calabrian peninsula they do not now
form any part of the Apennine chain. But that in Tertiary
times there was a high interior zone of crystalline rocks is
indicated by the character of the Eocene beds in the southern
Apennines. These are formed to a large extent of thick conglomerates
which are full of pebbles and boulders of granite and
schist. Many of the boulders are of considerable size and they
are often still angular. There is now no crystalline region from
which they could reach their present position; and this and
other considerations have led the followers of E. Suess to conclude
that even in Tertiary times a large land mass consisting of
ancient rocks occupied the space which is now covered by the
southern portion of the Tyrrhenian Sea. This old land mass
has been called Tyrrhenis, and probably extended from Sicily
into Latium and as far west as Sardinia. On the Italian border
of this land there was raised a mountain chain with an inner
crystalline zone and an outer zone of Mesozoic and Tertiary
beds. Subsequent faulting has caused the subsidence of the
greater part of Tyrrhenis, including nearly the whole of the
inner zone of the mountain chain, and has left only the outer
zones standing as the present Apennines.</p>

<p>Be this as it may, the Apennines, excepting in Calabria, are
formed chiefly of Triassic, Jurassic, Cretaceous, Eocene and
Miocene beds. In the south the deposits, from the Trias to the
middle Eocene, consist mainly of limestones, and were laid
down, with a few slight interruptions, upon a quietly subsiding
sea-floor. In the later part of the Eocene period began the
folding which gave rise to the existing chain. The sea grew
shallow, the deposits became conglomeratic and shaly, volcanic
eruptions began, and the present folds of the Apennines were
initiated. The folding and consequent elevation went on until
the close of the Miocene period when a considerable subsidence
took place and the Pliocene sea overspread the lower portions
of the range. Subsequent elevation, without folding, has raised
these Pliocene deposits to a considerable height&mdash;in some cases
over 3000 ft. and they now lie almost undisturbed upon the
older folded beds. This last elevation led to the formation of
numerous lakes which are now filled up by Pleistocene deposits.
Both volcanic eruptions and movements of elevation and
depression continue to the present day on the shores of the
Tyrrhenian Sea. In the northern Apennines the elevation of the
sea floor appears to have begun at an earlier period, for the
Upper Cretaceous of that part of the chain consists largely of
sandstones and conglomerates. In Calabria the chain consists
chiefly of crystalline and schistose rocks; it is the Mesozoic and
Tertiary zone which has here been sunk beneath the sea.
Similar rocks are found beneath the Trias farther north, in some
of the valleys of Basilicata. Glaciers no longer exist in the
Apennines, but Post-Pliocene moraines have been observed in
Basilicata.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APHASIA<a name="ar208" id="ar208"></a></span><a name="fa1i" id="fa1i" href="#ft1i"><span class="sp">1</span></a> (from Gr. &alpha;, privative, and <span class="grk" title="phasis">&#966;&#940;&#963;&#953;&#962;</span>, speech), a term
which means literally inability to speak, and is used to denote
various defects in the comprehension and expression of both
spoken and written language which result from lesions of the
brain. Aphasic disorders may be classed in two groups:&mdash;first,
receptive or sensory aphasia, which comprises (<i>a</i>) inability to
understand spoken language (auditory aphasia), and (<i>b</i>) inability
to read (visual aphasia, or <i>alexia</i>); second, emissive or motor
aphasia, under which category are included (<i>a</i>) inability to speak
(motor vocal aphasia, or <i>aphemia</i>), and (<i>b</i>) inability to write
(motor graphic aphasia, or <i>agraphia</i>). It has been shown that
each of these defects is produced by destruction of a special
region of the cortex of the brain. These regions, which are
termed the speech centres, are, in right-handed people, situated
in the left cerebral hemisphere; this is the reason why aphasia
is so commonly associated with paralysis of the right side of the
body.</p>

<p>A study of the acquisition of the faculty of speech throws
light upon the education of the speech centres, and helps to
elucidate their physiological interaction and the phenomena of
aphasia. The auditory speech centre is the first to show signs
of functional activity, for within a few months of birth the child
begins to <i>understand</i> spoken language. Some months later the
motor vocal speech centre begins to functionate. The memories
of the auditory word images which are stored up in the auditory
speech centre play a most important part in the process of
learning to speak. The child born deaf grows up mute. The
visual speech centre comes into activity when the child is taught
to read. Again, when he learns to write and thus begins to
educate his graphic centre, he is constantly calling upon his
visual speech centre for the visual images of the words he wishes
to produce. From these remarks it will be seen that there is a
very intimate association between the auditory speech centre
and the motor vocal speech centre, also between the visual speech
centre and the graphic centre.</p>

<p><i>Auditory Aphasia.</i>&mdash;The auditory speech centre is situated in
the posterior part of the first and second temporo-sphenoidal
convolutions on the left side of the brain. Destruction of this
centre causes &ldquo;auditory aphasia.&rdquo; Hearing is unimpaired but
spoken language is quite unintelligible. The subject of auditory
aphasia may be compared to an individual who is listening to a
foreign language of which he does not understand a word.
Word deafness, a term often used as synonymous with auditory
aphasia, is misleading and should be abandoned. Auditory
aphasia commonly interferes with vocal expression, for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page164" id="page164"></a>164</span>
majority of people when they speak do so by recalling the
auditory memories of words stored up in the auditory speech
centre. <i>Amnesia verbalis</i> is employed to designate failure to
call up in the memory the images of words which are needed for
purposes of vocal expression or silent thought.</p>

<p><i>Visual Aphasia or Alexia.</i>&mdash;The visual speech centre, which is
located in the left angular gyrus, is connected with the two
centres for vision which are situated one in either occipital lobe.
Destruction of the visual speech centre produces visual aphasia
or alexia. Word blindness, sometimes used as the equivalent
of visual aphasia, is, like word deafness, a misleading term.
The individual is not blind, he sees the words and letters perfectly,
but they appear to him as unintelligible cyphers. When
the visual speech centre is destroyed, the memories of the visual
images of words are obliterated and interference with writing,
a consequence of <i>amnesia verbalis</i>, results. On the other hand,
when the lesion is situated deeply in the occipital lobe, and does
not implicate the cortex, but merely cuts off the connexions of
the angular gyrus with both visual centres, agraphia is not
produced, for the visual word centre and its connexion with
the graphic centre are still intact (pure, or sub-cortical word
blindness).</p>

<p><i>Motor Vocal Aphasia or Aphemia.</i>&mdash;The centre for motor
vocal speech is situated in the posterior part of the third left
frontal convolution and extends on to the foot of the left ascending
frontal convolution (Broca&rsquo;s convolution). Complete destruction
of this region produces loss of speech, although it often
happens that a few words, such as &ldquo;yes&rdquo; and &ldquo;no,&rdquo; and, it
may be, emotional exclamations such as &ldquo;Oh! dear!&rdquo; and the
like are retained. The utterance of unintelligible sounds is still
possible, however, and there is neither defective voice production
(<i>aphonia</i>) nor paralysis of the mechanism of articulation. The
individual can recall the auditory and visual images of the words
which he wishes to use, but his memory for the complicated,
co-ordinated movements which he acquired in the process of
learning to speak, and which are necessary for vocal expression,
has been blotted out. In the great majority of cases of motor
vocal aphasia there is associated agraphia, a circumstance which
is perhaps to be accounted for by the proximity of the graphic
centre. When the lesion is situated below the cortex of Broca&rsquo;s
convolution but destroys the fibres which pass from it towards
the internal capsule, agraphia is not produced (sub-cortical or
pure motor vocal aphasia). Destruction of the auditory speech
centre is, as we have seen, commonly accompanied by more or
less interference with vocal speech, a consequence of <i>amnesia
verbalis</i>.</p>

<p><i>Agraphia.</i>&mdash;Discussion still rages as to the presence of a special
writing centre. Those who favour the separate existence of a
graphic centre locate it in the second left frontal convolution.
It may be that the want of unanimity as to the graphic
centre is to be explained by an anatomical relationship so close
between the graphic centre and that for the fine movement of
the hand that a lesion in this situation which produces agraphia
must at the same time cause a paralysis of the hand. Destruction
of the visual speech centre by obliterating the visual memories of
words (<i>amnesia verbalis</i>) produces agraphia. Further, several
instances are on record in which agraphia has followed destruction
of the commissure between the visual speech centre and the
graphic centre. As already mentioned, agraphia is very often
associated with motor vocal aphasia.</p>

<p>A number of aphasic defects are met with in addition to those
already mentioned. Thus <i>paraphasia</i> is a condition in which
the patient makes use of words other than those he intends.
He may mix up his words so that his conversation is quite
unintelligible. In the most pronounced forms he gabbles away,
employing unrecognizable sounds in place of words (<i>jargon and
gibberish aphasia</i>). <i>Paragraphia</i> is a similar defect which occurs
in writing. Both paraphasia and paragraphia may be produced
by partial lesions of the sensory speech centres or of the commissures
which connect these with the motor centres. <i>Object
blindness</i> (syn. mind-blindness) refers to an inability to recognize
an object or its uses by the aid of sight alone. The probable
explanation would seem to be that the ordinary centre for vision
has been isolated from the other sensory centres with which it
is connected. Not uncommonly there is associated visual
aphasia. <i>Optic aphasia</i> was introduced to designate a somewhat
similar state in which, although the uses of an object are recognized,
the patient cannot name it at sight, yet, if it is of such a
nature that it appeals directly to one of the other senses, he may
at once be able to name it. <i>Tactile aphasia</i>, is a rare defect in
which there exists an inability to recognize an object by touch
alone although the qualities which, under normal circumstances,
suffice for its detection can be accurately described. <i>Amusia</i>,
or loss of the musical faculty, may occur in association with or
independent of aphasia. There is reason for believing that
special receptive and emissive centres exist for the musical
sense exactly analogous to those for speech.</p>

<p>The speech centres are all supplied by the left middle cerebral
artery. When this artery is blocked close to its origin by an
<i>embolus</i> or <i>thrombus</i>, total aphasia results. It may be, however,
that only one of the smaller branches of the artery is obstructed,
and, according to the region of the brain to which this branch
is distributed, one or more of the speech centres may be destroyed.
Occlusion of the left posterior cerebral artery causes extensive
softening of the occipital lobe and produces pure word blindness.
Further, a tumour, abscess, haemorrhage or meningitis may be
so situated as to damage or destroy the individual speech centres
or their connecting commissures. The amount of recovery to
be expected in any given case depends upon the nature, situation
and extent of the lesion, and upon the age of the patient. Even
after complete destruction of the speech centres, perfect recovery
may take place, for the centres in the right hemisphere of the
brain are capable of education. This is only possible in young
individuals. In the great majority of instances the nature of
the lesion is such as to render futile all treatment directed
towards its removal. In suitable cases, however, the education
of the right side of the brain may be very greatly assisted by an
intelligent application of scientific methods.</p>

<p><a name="ft1i" id="ft1i" href="#fa1i"><span class="fn">1</span></a> In 1906 Pierre Marie of Paris expressed views (<i>La Semaine
medicale</i>, May 23 and October 17, and elsewhere) upon the question
of aphasia which have given rise to much animated controversy,
since they are in many respects at complete variance with the
classical conception which has been represented in the present
article. Marie holds that Broca&rsquo;s convolution plays no special role
in the function of speech. He admits that a lesion in the region of
the lenticular nucleus is followed by inability to speak, but this
defect is, in his opinion, to be regarded as an anarthria. He further
admits the production of sensory aphasia&mdash;the aphasia of Wernicke,
as he prefers to call it after its discoverer&mdash;by lesions which destroy
the angular and supramarginal gyri, and the upper two temporo-sphenoidal
convolutions, but he regards the essential foundation of
sensory aphasia as a diminution of intelligence. There are, in his
opinion, no sensory images of language. Motor aphasia is, he believes,
nothing more than a combination of sensory aphasia and anarthria.
These conclusions have been vigorously attacked, more especially
by Dejerine of Paris (<i>La Presse medicale</i>, July 1906 and elsewhere).</p>

<p><span class="bold">APHIDES<a name="ar211" id="ar211"></a></span> (pl. of Aphis), minute insects, also known as
&ldquo;plant-lice,&rdquo; &ldquo;blight,&rdquo; and &ldquo;green-fly,&rdquo; belonging to the
homopterous division of the order Hemiptera, with long antennae
and legs, two-jointed, two-clawed tarsi, and usually a pair of
abdominal tubes through which a waxy secretion is exuded.
These tubes were formerly supposed to secrete the sweet substance
known as &ldquo;honey-dew&rdquo; so much sought after by ants; but
this is now known to come from the alimentary canal. Both
winged and wingless forms of both sexes occur, and the wings
when present are normal in number, that is to say two pairs.
Apart from their importance from the economic standpoint,
Aphides are chiefly remarkable for the phenomena connected
with the propagation of the species. The following brief
summary of what takes place in the plant-louse of the rose
(<i>Aphis rosae</i>), may be regarded as typical of the family, though
exceptions occur in other species: Eggs produced in the autumn
by fertilized females remain on the plant through the winter
and hatching in the spring give rise to female individuals
which may be winged or wingless. From these females are born
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page165" id="page165"></a>165</span>
parthenogenetically, that is to say without the intervention of
males, and by a process that has been compared to internal budding,
large numbers of young resembling their parents in every
particular except size, which themselves reproduce their kind
in the same way. This process continues throughout the summer,
generation after generation being produced until the number
of descendants from a single individual of the spring-hatched
brood may amount to very many thousands. In the autumn
winged males appear, union between the sexes takes place and
the females lay the fertilized eggs which are destined to carry
the species through the cold months of winter. If, however,
the food-plant is grown in a conservatory where protection
against cold is afforded, the aphides may go on reproducing
agamogenetically without cessation for many years together.
Not the least interesting features connected with this strange
life-history are the facts that the young may be born by the
oviparous or viviparous methods and either gamogenetically
or agamogenetically, and may develop into winged forms or
remain wingless, and that the males only appear in any number
at the close of the season. Although the factors which determine
these phenomena are not clearly understood, it is believed that
the appearance of the males is connected with the increasing
cold of autumn and the growing scarcity of food, and that the
birth of winged females is similarly associated with decrease in
the quantity or vitiation of the quality of the nourishment
imbibed. Sometimes the winged females migrate from the
plant they were born on to start fresh colonies on others often
of quite a different kind. Thus the apple blight (<i>Aphis mali</i>)
after producing many generations of apterous females on its
typical food-plant gives rise to winged forms which fly away
and settle upon grass or corn-stalks.</p>

<p>Closely related to the typical aphides is <i>Phylloxera vastatrix</i>,
the insect which causes enormous loss by attacking the leaves
and roots of vines. Its life-history is somewhat similar to that of
<i>Aphis rosae</i> summarized above. In the autumn a single fertile
egg is laid by apterous females in a crevice of the bark of the
vine where it is protected during the winter. From this egg in
the spring emerges an apterous female who makes a gall in the
new leaf and lays therein a large number of eggs. Some of the
apterous young that are hatched from these form fresh galls
and continue to multiply in the leaves, others descend to the
root of the plant, becoming what are known as root-forms.
These, like the parent form of spring, reproduce parthenogenetically,
giving rise to generation after generation of egg-laying
individuals. In the course of the summer, from some of these
eggs are hatched females which acquire wings and lay eggs from
which wingless males and females are born. From the union of
the sexes comes the fertile egg from which the parent form of
spring is hatched.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APHORISM<a name="ar212" id="ar212"></a></span> (from the Gr. <span class="grk" title="aphorizein">&#7936;&#966;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#950;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>, to define), literally a
distinction or a definition, a term used to describe a principle
expressed tersely in a few telling words or any general truth
conveyed in a short and pithy sentence, in such a way that when
once heard it is unlikely to pass from the memory. The name
was first used in the <i>Aphorisms</i> of Hippocrates, a long series of
propositions concerning the symptoms and diagnosis of disease
and the art of healing and medicine. The term came to be
applied later to other sententious statements of physical science,
and later still to statements of all kinds of principles. Care
must be taken not to confound <i>aphorisms</i> with <i>axioms</i>. Aphorisms
came into being as the result of experience, whereas axioms
are self-evident truths, requiring no proof, and appertain to
pure reason. Aphorisms have been especially used in dealing with
subjects to which no methodical or scientific treatment was
applied till late, such as art, agriculture, medicine, jurisprudence
and politics. The <i>Aphorisms</i> of Hippocrates form far the most
celebrated as well as the earliest collection of the kind, and it
may be interesting to quote a few examples. &ldquo;Old men support
abstinence well: people of a ripe age less well: young folk
badly, and children less well than all the rest, particularly those
of them who are very lively.&rdquo; &ldquo;Those who are very fat by nature
are more exposed to die suddenly than those who are thin.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Those who eject foaming blood, eject it from the lung.&rdquo;
&ldquo;When two illnesses arrive at the same time, the stronger
silences the weaker.&rdquo; The first aphorism, perhaps the best
known of all, which serves as a kind of introduction to the book,
runs as follows:&mdash;&ldquo;Life is short, art is long, opportunity fugitive,
experimenting dangerous, reasoning difficult: it is necessary
not only to do oneself what is right, but also to be seconded by
the patient, by those who attend him, by external circumstances.&rdquo;
Another famous collection of aphorisms is that of the
school of Salerno in Latin verse, in which Joannes de Meditano,
one of the most celebrated doctors of the school of medicine of
Salerno, has summed up the precepts of this school. The book
was dedicated to a king of England. It is a disputed point as
to which king, some authorities dating the publication as at 1066,
others assigning a later date. The dedication gives the following
excellent advice:&mdash;</p>

<table class="reg" summary="poem"><tr><td> <div class="poemr">

<p>Another collection of aphorisms, also medical and also in
Latin, is that of the Dutchman Hermann Boerhaave, published
at Leiden in the year 1709; it gives a terse summary of the
medical knowledge prevailing at the time, and is of great interest
to the student of the history of medicine.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APHRAATES<a name="ar213" id="ar213"></a></span> (a Greek form of the Persian name Aphraha&#7789; or
Pharhadh), a Syriac writer belonging to the middle of the 4th
century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, who composed a series of twenty-three expositions
or homilies on points of Christian doctrine and practice. The
first ten were written in 337, the following twelve in 344, and
the last in 345.<a name="fa1j" id="fa1j" href="#ft1j"><span class="sp">1</span></a> The author was early known as <i>&#7717;akk&#299;m&#257;
ph&#257;rs&#257;y&#257;</i> (&ldquo;the Persian sage&rdquo;), was a subject of Sapor II., and
was probably of heathen parentage and himself a convert from
heathenism. He seems at some time in his life to have assumed
the name of Jacob, and is so entitled in the colophon to a MS.
of <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 512 which contains twelve of his homilies. Hence he was
already by Gennadius of Marseilles (before 496) confused with
Jacob, bishop of Nisibis; and the ancient Armenian version of
nineteen of the homilies has been published under this latter
name. But (1) Jacob of Nisibis, who attended the council of
Nicaea, died in 338; and (2) our author, being a Persian subject,
cannot have lived at Nisibis, which became Persian only by
Jovian&rsquo;s treaty of 363. That his name was Aphrahat or
Pharhadh we learn from comparatively late writers&mdash;Bar Bahlul
(10th century), Elias of Nisibis (11th), Bar-Hebraeus, and
&lsquo;Abhd-&#299;sh&#333;&rsquo;. George, bishop of the Arabs, writing in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 714 to a
friend who had sent him a series of questions about the &ldquo;Persian
sage,&rdquo; confesses ignorance of his name, home and rank, but
infers from his homilies that he was a monk, and of high esteem
among the clergy. The fact that in 344 he was selected to draw
up a circular letter from a council of bishops and other clergy to
the churches of Seleucia and Ctesiphon and elsewhere&mdash;included
in our collection as homily 14&mdash;is held by Dr W. Wright and
others to prove that he was a bishop. According to a marginal
note in a 14th-century MS. (B.M. Orient. 1017), he was &ldquo;bishop
of Mar Mattai,&rdquo; a famous monastery near Mosul, but it is unlikely
that this institution existed so early. The homilies of
Aphraates are intended to form, as Professor Burkitt has shown,
&ldquo;a full and ordered exposition of the Christian faith.&rdquo; The
standpoint is that of the Syriac-speaking church, before it was
touched by the Arian controversy. Beginning with faith as the
foundation, the writer proceeds to build up the Structure of
doctrine and duty. The first ten homilies, which form one
division completed in 337, are without polemical reference;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page166" id="page166"></a>166</span>
their subjects are faith, love, fasting, prayer, wars (a somewhat
mysterious setting forth of the conflict between Rome and
Persia under the imagery of Daniel), the sons of the covenant
(monks or ascetics), penitents, the resurrection, humility,
pastors. Those numbered 11-22, written in 344, are almost all
directed against the Jews; the subjects are circumcision,
passover, the sabbath, persuasion (the encyclical letter referred
to above), distinction of meats, the substitution of the Gentiles
for the Jews, that Christ is the Son of God, virginity and holiness,
whether the Jews have been finally rejected or are yet to be
restored, provision for the poor, persecution, death and the last
times. The 23rd homily, on the &ldquo;grape kernel&rdquo; (Is. lxv. 8),
written in 344, forms an appendix on the Messianic fulfilment of
prophecy, together with a treatment of the chronology from
Adam to Christ. Aphraates impresses a reader favourably by
his moral earnestness, his guilelessness, his moderation in
controversy, the simplicity of his style and language, his saturation
with the ideas and words of Scripture. On the other hand, he is
full of cumbrous repetition, he lacks precision in argument and
is prone to digression, his quotations from Scripture are often
inappropriate, and he is greatly influenced by Jewish exegesis.
He is particularly fond of arguments about numbers. How
wholly he and his surroundings were untouched by the Arian
conflict may be judged from the 17th homily&mdash;&ldquo;that Christ is
the Son of God.&rdquo; He argues that, as the name &ldquo;God&rdquo; or &ldquo;Son
of God&rdquo; was given in the O.T. to men who were worthy, and as
God does not withhold from men a share in His attributes&mdash;such
as sovereignty and fatherhood&mdash;it was fitting that Christ who
has wrought salvation for mankind should obtain this highest
name. From the frequency of his quotations, Aphraates is a
specially important witness to the form in which the Gospels
were read in the Syriac church in his day; Zahn and others
have shown that he&mdash;mainly at least&mdash;used the <i>Diatessaron</i>.
Finally, he bears important contemporary witness to the sufferings
of the Christian church in Persia under Sapor (Shapur) II.
as well as the moral evils which had infected the church, to the
sympathy of Persian Christians with the cause of the Roman
empire, to the condition of early monastic institutions, to the
practice of the Syriac church in regard to Easter, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APHRODITE,<a name="ar214" id="ar214"></a></span><a name="fa1k" id="fa1k" href="#ft1k"><span class="sp">1</span></a> the Greek goddess of love and beauty, counterpart
of the Roman Venus. Although her myth and cult were
essentially Semitic, she soon became Hellenized and was admitted
to a place among the deities of Olympus. Some mythologists
hold that there already existed in the Greek system an earlier
goddess of love, of similar attributes, who was absorbed by the
Asiatic importation; and one writer (A. Enmann) goes so far
as to deny the oriental origin of Aphrodite altogether. It is
therefore necessary first to examine the nature and
characteristics of her Eastern prototype, and then to see how far they
reappear in the Greek Aphrodite.</p>

<p>Among the Semitic peoples (with the notable exception of
the Hebrews) a supreme female deity was worshipped under
different names&mdash;the Assyrian Ishtar, the Phoenician Ashtoreth
(Astarte), the Syrian Atargatis (Derketo), the Babylonian Belit
(Mylitta), the Arabian Ilat (Al-ilat). The article &ldquo;Aphrodite&rdquo;
in Roscher&rsquo;s <i>Lexikon der Mythologie</i> is based upon the theory
that all these were originally moon-goddesses, on which assumption
all their functions are explained. This view, however, has
not met with general acceptance, on the ground that, in Semitic
mythology, the moon is always a male divinity; and that the
full moon and crescent, found as attributes of Astarte, are due
to a misinterpretation of the sun&rsquo;s disk and cow&rsquo;s horns of Isis,
the result of the dependence of Syrian religious art upon Egypt.
On the other hand, there is some evidence in ancient authorities
(Herodian v. 6, 10; Lucian, <i>De Dea Syria</i>, 4) that Astarte and
the moon were considered identical.</p>

<p>This oriental Aphrodite was worshipped as the bestower of
all animal and vegetable fruitfulness, and under this aspect
especially as a goddess of women. This worship was degraded
by repulsive practices (<i>e.g.</i> religious prostitution, self-mutilation),
which subsequently made their way to centres of Phoenician
influence, such as Corinth and Mount Eryx in Sicily. In this
connexion may be mentioned the idea of a divinity, half male,
half female, uniting in itself the active and passive functions of
creation, a symbol of luxuriant growth and productivity. Such
was the bearded Aphrodite of Cyprus, called Aphrodites by
Aristophanes according to Macrobius, who mentions a statue
of the androgynous divinity in his <i>Saturnalia</i> (iii. 8. 2; see also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hermaphroditus</a></span>). The moon, by its connexion with menstruation,
and as the cause of the fertilizing dew, was regarded as
exercising an influence over the entire animal and vegetable
creation.</p>

<p>The Eastern Aphrodite was closely related to the sea and the
element of moisture; in fact, some consider that she made her
first appearance on Greek soil rather as a marine divinity than
as a nature goddess. According to Syrian ideas, as a fish goddess,
she represented the fructifying power of water. At Ascalon
there was a lake full of fish near the temple of Atargatis-Derketo,
into which she was said to have been thrown together with her
son Ichthys (fish) as a punishment for her arrogance, and to
have been devoured by fishes; according to another version,
ashamed of her amour with a beautiful youth, which resulted
in the birth of Semiramis, she attempted to drown herself, but
was changed into a fish with human face (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Atargatis</a></span>). At
Hierapolis (Bambyce) there was a pool with an altar in the
middle, sacred to the goddess, where a festival was held, at which
her images were carried into the water. Her connexion with the
sea is explained by the influence of the moon on the tides, and
the idea that the moon, like the sun and the stars, came up from
the ocean.</p>

<p>The oriental Aphrodite is connected with the lower world, and
came to be looked upon as one of its divinities. Thus, Ishtar
descends to the kingdom of Ilat the queen of the dead, to find
the means of restoring her favourite Tammuz (Adon, Adonis)
to life. During her stay all animal and vegetable productivity
ceases, to begin again with her return to earth&mdash;a clear indication
of the conception of her as a goddess of fertility. This legend,
which strikingly resembles that of Persephone, probably refers
to the decay of vegetation in winter, and the reawakening of
nature in spring (cf. <span class="sc">Hyacinthus</span>). The lunar theory connects
it with the disappearance of the moon at the time of change or
during an eclipse.</p>

<p>Another aspect of her character is that of a warlike goddess,
armed with spear or bow, sometimes wearing a mural crown,
as sovereign lady and protectress of the locality where she was
worshipped. The spear and arrows are identified with the
beams of the sun and moon.</p>

<p>The attributes of the goddess were the ram, the he-goat, the
dove, certain fish, the cypress, myrtle and pomegranate, the
animals being symbolical of fertility, the plants remedies against
sterility.</p>

<p>The worship of Aphrodite at an early date was introduced
into Cyprus, Cythera and Crete by Phoenician colonists, whence
it spread over the whole of Greece, and as far west as Italy and
Sicily. In Crete she has been identified with Ariadne, who,
according to one version of her story, was put ashore in Cyprus,
where she died and was buried in a grove called after the name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page167" id="page167"></a>167</span>
of Ariadne-Aphrodite (L.R. Farnell, <i>Cults of the Greek States</i>,
ii. p. 663). Cyprus was regarded as her true home by the Greeks,
and Cythera was one of the oldest seats of her worship (cf. her
titles Cytherea, Cypris, Paphia, Amathusia, Idalia&mdash;the last
three from places in Cyprus). In both these islands there
lingered a definite tradition of a connexion with the cult of the
oriental Aphrodite Urania, an epithet which will be referred to
later. The oriental features of her worship as practised at
Corinth are due to its early commercial relations with Asia
Minor; the fame of her temple worship on Mount Eryx spread
to Carthage, Rome and Latium.</p>

<p>In the <i>Iliad</i>, Aphrodite is the daughter of Zeus and Dione, a
name by which she herself is sometimes called. This has been
supposed to point to a confusion between Aphrodite and Hebe,
the daughter of Zeus and Hera, Dione being an Epirot name
for the last-named goddess. In the <i>Odyssey</i>, she is the wife of
Hephaestus, her place being taken in the <i>Iliad</i> by Charis, the
personification of grace and divine skill, possibly supplanted
by Aphrodite, the goddess of love and beauty. Her amour
with Ares, by whom she became the mother of Harmonia, the
wife of Cadmus, is famous (<i>Od.</i> viii. 266). From her relations
with these acknowledged Hellenic divinites it is argued that there
once existed a primitive Greek goddess of love. This view is
examined in detail and rejected by Farnell (<i>Cults</i>, ii. pp. 619-626).</p>

<p>It is admitted that few traces remain of direct relations of the
Greek goddess to the moon, although such possibly survive in
the epithets <span class="grk" title="pasiphês, asteria, ourania">&#960;&#945;&#963;&#953;&#966;&#945;&#942;&#962;, &#7936;&#963;&#964;&#949;&#961;&#943;&#945;, &#959;&#8016;&#961;&#945;&#957;&#943;&#945;</span>. It is suggested that
this is due to the fact that, at the time of the adoption of the
oriental goddess, the Greeks already possessed lunar divinities
in Hecate, Selene, Artemis. But, although her connexion with
the moon has practically disappeared, in all other aspects a
development from the Semitic divinity is clearly manifest.</p>

<p>Aphrodite as the goddess of all fruitfulness in the animal and
vegetable world is especially prominent. In the Homeric hymn
to Aphrodite she is described as ruling over all living things on
earth, in the air, and in the water, even the gods being subject
to her influence. She is the goddess of gardens, especially
worshipped in spring and near lowlands and marshes, favourable
to the growth of vegetation. As such in Crete she is called
Antheia (&ldquo;the flower-goddess&rdquo;), at Athens <span class="grk" title="en kepois">&#7952;&#957; &#954;&#942;&#960;&#959;&#953;&#962;</span> (&ldquo;in the
gardens&rdquo;), and <span class="grk" title="en kalamois">&#7952;&#957; &#954;&#945;&#955;&#940;&#956;&#959;&#953;&#962;</span> (&ldquo;in the reed-beds&rdquo;) or <span class="grk" title="en elei">&#7952;&#957; &#7956;&#955;&#949;&#953;</span>
(&ldquo;in the marsh&rdquo;) at Samos. Her character as a goddess of
vegetation is clearly shown in the cult and ritual of Adonis
(<i>q.v.</i>; also Farnell, ii. p. 644) and Attis (<i>q.v.</i>). In the animal
world she is the goddess of sexual impulse; amongst men, of
birth, marriage, and family life. To this aspect may be referred
the names Genetyllis (&ldquo;bringing about birth&rdquo;), Arma (<span class="grk" title="aro">&#7940;&#961;&#969;</span>,
&ldquo;to join,&rdquo; <i>i.e.</i>, in marriage, cf. Harmonia), Nymphia (&ldquo;bridal
goddess&rdquo;), Kourotrophos (&ldquo;rearer of boys&rdquo;). Aphrodite
Apaturus (see G.M. Hirst in <i>Journal of Hellenic Studies</i>, xxiii.,
1903) refers to her connexion with the clan and the festival
Apaturia, at which children were admitted to the <i>phratria</i>. It
is pointed out by Farnell that this cult of Aphrodite, as the
patroness of married life, is probably a native development of
the Greek religion, the oriental legends representing her by no
means as an upholder of the purer relations of man and woman.
As the goddess of the grosser form of love she inspires both men
and women with passion (<span class="grk" title="epistrophia">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;</span>, &ldquo;turning them to&rdquo;
thoughts of love), or the reverse (<span class="grk" title="apostrophia">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#943;&#945;</span>, &ldquo;turning them
away&rdquo;). Upon her male favourites (Paris, Theseus) she bestows
the fatal gift of seductive beauty, which generally leads to
disastrous results in the case of the woman (Helen, Ariadne).
As <span class="grk" title="mechanitis">&#956;&#951;&#967;&#945;&#957;&#8150;&#964;&#953;&#962;</span> (&ldquo;contriver&rdquo;) she acts as an intermediary for
bringing lovers together, a similar idea being expressed in <span class="grk" title="prêis">&#960;&#961;&#8118;&#958;&#953;&#962;</span>
(of &ldquo;success&rdquo; in love, or=<i>creatrix</i>). The two epithets <span class="grk" title="androphonos">&#7936;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#959;&#966;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>
(&ldquo;man-slayer&rdquo;) and <span class="grk" title="sosandra">&#963;&#974;&#963;&#945;&#957;&#948;&#961;&#945;</span> (&ldquo;man-preserver&rdquo;) find an
illustration in the pseudo-Plautine (in the <i>Mercator</i>) address to
Astarte, who is described as the life and death, the saviour and
destroyer of men and gods. It was natural that a personality
invested with such charms should be regarded as the ideal of
womanly beauty, but it is remarkable that the only probable
instance in which she appears as such is as Aphrodite <span class="grk" title="morpho">&#956;&#959;&#961;&#966;&#974;</span>
(&ldquo;form&rdquo;) at Sparta (O. Gruppe suggests the meaning &ldquo;ghost,&rdquo;
C. Tumpel the &ldquo;dark one,&rdquo; referring to Aphrodite&rsquo;s connexion
with the lower world). The function of Aphrodite as the
patroness of courtesans represents the most degraded form of
her worship as the goddess of love, and is certainly of Phoenician
or Eastern origin. In Corinth there were more than a thousand
of these <span class="grk" title="ierodouloi">&#7985;&#949;&#961;&#972;&#948;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#959;&#953;</span> (&ldquo;temple slaves&rdquo;), and wealthy men made
it a point of honour to dedicate their most beautiful slaves to
the service of the goddess.</p>

<p>Like her oriental prototype, the Greek Aphrodite was closely
connected with the sea. Thus, in the Hesiodic account of her
birth, she is represented as sprung from the foam which gathered
round the mutilated member of Uranus, and her name has been
explained by reference to this. Further proof may be found in
many of her titles&mdash;<span class="grk" title="anaduomenê">&#7936;&#957;&#945;&#948;&#965;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951;</span> (&ldquo;rising from the sea&rdquo;), <span class="grk" title="enploia">&#949;&#8020;&#960;&#955;&#959;&#953;&#945;</span>
(&ldquo;giver of prosperous voyages&rdquo;), <span class="grk" title="galenaia">&#947;&#945;&#955;&#951;&#957;&#945;&#943;&#945;</span> (&ldquo;goddess of fair
weather&rdquo;), <span class="grk" title="kataskopia">&#954;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#963;&#954;&#959;&#960;&#943;&#945;</span> (&ldquo;she who keeps a look-out from the
heights&rdquo;)&mdash;in the attribute of the dolphin, and the veneration
in which she was held by seafarers. Aphrodite Aineias, the
protectress of the Trojan hero, is probably also another form
of the maritime goddess of the East (see E. Worner, article
&ldquo;Aineias&rdquo; in Roscher&rsquo;s <i>Lexikon</i>, and Farnell, ii. p. 638), which
originated in the Troad, where Aphrodite Aineias may have
been identical with the earth-goddess Cybele. The title <span class="grk" title="ephippos">&#7956;&#966;&#953;&#960;&#960;&#959;&#962;</span>
is connected with the legend of Aeneas, who is said to have
dedicated to his mother a statue that represented her on horseback.
Remembering the importance of the horse in the cult
of the sea-god Poseidon, it is natural to associate it with Aphrodite
as the sea-goddess, although it may be explained with
reference to her character as a goddess of vegetation, the horse
being an embodiment of the corn-spirit (see J.G. Frazer, <i>The
Golden Bough</i>, ii., 1900, p. 281).</p>

<p>Like Ishtar, Aphrodite was connected with the lower world.
Thus, at Delphi there was an image of Aphrodite <span class="grk" title="epitumbia">&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#964;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#943;&#945;</span>
(&ldquo;Aphrodite of the tomb&rdquo;), to which the dead were summoned
to receive libations; the epithets <span class="grk" title="tumboruchos">&#964;&#965;&#956;&#946;&#974;&#961;&#965;&#967;&#959;&#962;</span> (&ldquo;grave-digger&rdquo;),
<span class="grk" title="muchia">&#956;&#965;&#967;&#943;&#945;</span> (&ldquo;goddess of the depths&rdquo;), <span class="grk" title="melainis">&#956;&#949;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#957;&#943;&#962;</span> (&ldquo;the dark one&rdquo;),
the grave of Ariadne-Aphrodite at Amathus, and the myth of
Adonis, point in the same direction.</p>

<p>The cult of the armed Aphrodite probably belongs to the
earlier period of her worship in Greece, and down to the latest
period of Greek history she retained this character in some of the
Greek states. The cult is found not only where oriental influence
was strongest, but in places remote from it, such as Sparta,
where she was known by the name of Areia (&ldquo;the warlike&rdquo;),
and there are numerous references in the <i>Anthology</i> to an
Aphrodite armed with helmet and spear. It is possible that the
frequent association of Aphrodite with Ares is to be explained
by an armed Aphrodite early worshipped at Thebes, the most
ancient seat of the worship of Ares.</p>

<p>The most distinctively oriental title of the Greek Aphrodite
is Urania, the Semitic &ldquo;queen of the heavens.&rdquo; It has been
explained by reference to the lunar character of the goddess,
but more probably signifies &ldquo;she whose seat is in heaven,&rdquo;
whence she exercises her sway over the whole world&mdash;earth, sea,
and air alike. Her cult was first established in Cythera, probably
in connexion with the purple trade, and at Athens it is associated
with the legendary Porphyrion, the purple king. At Thebes,
Harmonia (who has been identified with Aphrodite herself)
dedicated three statues, of Aphrodite Urania, Pandemos, and
Apostrophia. A few words must be added on the second of
these titles. There is no doubt that Pandemos was originally an
extension of the idea of the goddess of family and city life to
include the whole people, the political community. Hence the
name was supposed to go back to the time of Theseus, the reputed
author of the reorganization of Attica and its demes. Aphrodite
Pandemos was held in equal regard with Urania; she was called
<span class="grk" title="semuê">&#963;&#949;&#956;&#957;&#942;</span> (&ldquo;holy&rdquo;), and was served by priestesses upon whom strict
chastity was enjoined. In time, however, the meaning of the
term underwent a change, probably due to the philosophers
and moralists, by whom a radical distinction was drawn between
Aphrodite Urania and Pandemos. According to Plato
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>168</span>
(<i>Symposium</i>, 180), there are two Aphrodites, &ldquo;the elder, having
no mother, who is called the heavenly Aphrodite&mdash;she is the
daughter of Uranus; the younger, who is the daughter of Zeus
and Dione&mdash;her we call common.&rdquo; The same distinction is
found in Xenophon&rsquo;s <i>Symposium</i> (viii. 9), although the author is
doubtful whether there are two goddesses, or whether Urania
and Pandemos are two names for the same goddess, just as Zeus,
although one and the same, has many titles; but in any case,
he says, the ritual of Urania is purer, more serious, than that of
Pandemos. The same idea is expressed in the statement (quoted
by Athenaeus, 569<i>d</i>, from Nicander of Colophon) that after
Solon&rsquo;s time courtesans were put under the protection of Aphrodite
Pandemos. But there is no doubt that the cult of Aphrodite
was on the whole as pure as that of any other divinities, and
although a distinction may have existed in later times between
the goddess of legal marriage and the goddess of free love, these
titles do not express the idea. Aphrodite Urania was represented
in Greek art on a swan, a tortoise or a globe; Aphrodite Pandemos
as riding on a goat, symbolical of wantonness. (For the
legend of Theseus and Aphrodite hepitagia, &ldquo;on the goat,&rdquo; see
Farnell, <i>Cults</i>, ii. p. 633.)</p>

<p>To her oriental attributes the following may be added: the
sparrow and hare (productivity), the wry-neck (as a love-charm,
of which Aphrodite was considered the inventor), the swan and
dolphin (as a marine divinity), the tortoise (explained by Plutarch
as a symbol of domesticity, but connected by Gruppe with the
marine deity), the rose, the poppy, and the lime tree.</p>

<p>In ancient art Aphrodite was at first represented clothed,
sometimes seated, but more frequently standing; then naked,
rising from the sea, or after the bath. Finally, all idea of the
divine vanished, and the artists merely presented her as the
type of a beautiful woman, with oval face, full of grace and
charm, languishing eyes, and laughing mouth, which replaced
the dignified severity and repose of the older forms. The most
famous of her statues in ancient times was that at Cnidus, the
work of Praxiteles, which was imitated on the coins of that town,
and subsequently reproduced in various copies, such as the
Vatican and Munich. Of existing statues the most famous is
the Aphrodite of Melos (Venus of Milo), now in the Louvre,
which was found on the island in 1820 amongst the ruins of the
theatre; the Capitoline Venus at Rome and the Venus of Capua,
represented as a goddess of victory (these two exhibit a lofty
conception of the goddess); the Medicean Venus at Florence,
found in the porticus of Octavia at Rome and (probably wrongly)
attributed to Cleomenes; the Venus stooping in the bath, in the
Vatican; and the Callipygos at Naples, a specimen of the most
sensual type.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APIS<a name="ar220" id="ar220"></a></span> or <span class="sc">Hapis</span>, the sacred bull of Memphis, in Egyptian <i>Hp,
Hope, Hope</i>. By Manetho his worship is said to have been
instituted by Kaiechos of the Second Dynasty. Hape is named
on very early monuments, but little is known of the divine
animal before the New Kingdom. He was entitled &ldquo;the renewal
of the life&rdquo; of the Memphite god Ptah: but after death
he became Osorapis, <i>i.e.</i> the Osiris Apis, just as dead men were
assimilated to Osiris, the king of the underworld. This Osorapis
was identified with Serapis, and may well be really identical
with him (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Serapis</a></span>): and Greek writers make the Apis an
incarnation of Osiris, ignoring the connexion with Ptah. Apis
was the most important of all the sacred animals in Egypt,
and, like the others, its importance increased as time went on.
Greek and Roman authors have much to say about Apis, the
marks by which the black bull-calf was recognized, the manner
of his conception by a ray from heaven, his house at Memphis
with court for disporting himself, the mode of prognostication
from his actions, the mourning at his death, his costly burial
and the rejoicings throughout the country when a new Apis
was found. Mariette&rsquo;s excavation of the Serapeum at Memphis
revealed the tombs of over sixty animals, ranging from the
time of Amenophis III. to that of Ptolemy Alexander. At first
each animal was buried in a separate tomb with a chapel built
above it. Khamuis, the priestly son of Rameses II. (<i>c.</i> 1300
<span class="scs">B.C.</span>), excavated a great gallery to be lined with the tomb
chambers; another similar gallery was added by Psammetichus I.
The careful statement of the ages of the animals in
the later instances, with the regnal dates for their birth, enthronization
and death have thrown much light on the
chronology from the XXIInd dynasty onwards. The name
of the mother-cow and the place of birth are often recorded.
The sarcophagi are of immense size, and the burial must have
entailed enormous expense. It is therefore remarkable that
the priests contrived to bury one of the animals in the fourth
year of Cambyses.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APLITE,<a name="ar221" id="ar221"></a></span> in petrology, the name given to intrusive rock in
which quartz and felspar are the dominant minerals. Aplites
are usually very fine-grained, white, grey or flesh-coloured, and
their constituents are visible only with the help of a magnifying
lens. Dykes and threads of aplite are very frequently to be
observed traversing granitic bosses; they occur also, though
in less numbers, in syenites, diorites, quartz-diabases and
gabbros. Without doubt they have usually a genetic affinity
to the rocks they intersect. The aplites of granite areas, for
example, are the last part of the magma to crystallize, and
correspond in composition to the quartzo-felspathic aggregates
which fill up the interspaces between the early minerals in the
main body of the rock. They bear a considerable resemblance
to the eutectic mixtures which are formed on the cooling of
solutions of mineral salts, and remain liquid till the excess of
either of the components has separated out, finally solidifying
<i>en masse</i> when the proper proportions of the constituents and a
suitable temperature are reached. The essential components
of the aplites are quartz and alkali felspar (the latter usually
orthoclase or microperthite). Crystallization has been apparently
rapid (as the rocks are so fine-grained), and the ingredients
have solidified almost at the same time. Hence their crystals
are rather imperfect and fit closely to one another in a sort of
fine mosaic of nearly equi-dimensional grains. Porphyritic
felspars occur occasionally and quartz more seldom; but the
relation of the aplites to quartz-porphyries, granophyres and
felsites is very close, as all these rocks have nearly the same
chemical composition. Yet the aplites associated with diorites
and quartz-diabases differ in minor respects from the common
aplites, which accompany granites. The accessory minerals
of these rocks are principally oligoclase, muscovite, apatite and
zircon. Biotite and all ferromagnesian minerals rarely appear
in them, and never are in considerable amount. Riebeckite-granites
(paisanites) have close affinities to aplites, shown
especially in the prevalence of alkali felspars. Tourmaline also
occurs in some aplites. The rocks of this group are very frequent
in all areas where masses of granite are known. They form
dykes and irregular veins which may be only a few inches or
many feet in diameter. Less frequently aplite forms stocks
or bosses, or occupies the edges or irregular portions of the
interior of outcrops of granite. The syenite-aplites consist
mainly of alkali felspar; the diorite-aplites of plagioclase;
there are nepheline-bearing aplites which intersect some
elaeolite-syenites. In all cases they bear the same relation to
the parent masses. By increase of quartz aplites pass gradually,
in a few localities, through highly quartzose modifications
(beresite, &amp;c.) into quartz veins.</p>

<p>The transition from prophecy to apocalyptic (<span class="grk" title="apokalyptein">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#973;&#960;&#964;&#949;&#953;&#957;</span>,
to reveal something hidden) was gradual and already accomplished
within the limits of the Old Testament. Beginning in
the bosom of prophecy, and steadily differentiating itself from
it in its successive developments, it never came to stand in
absolute contrast to it. Apocalyptical elements disclose themselves
in the prophetical books of Ezekiel, Joel, Zechariah,
while in Isaiah xxiv.-xxvii. and xxxiii. we find well-developed
apocalypses; but it is not until we come to Daniel that we have
a fully matured and classical example of this class of literature.
The way, however, had in an especial degree been prepared for
the apocalyptic type of thought and literature by Ezekiel, for
with him the word of God had become identical with a written
book (ii. 9-iii. 3) by the eating of which he learnt the will of God,
just as primitive man conceived that the eating of the tree in
Paradise imparted spiritual knowledge. When the divine word
is thus conceived as a written message, the sole office of the
prophet is to communicate what is written. Thus the human
element is reduced to zero, and the conception of prophecy
becomes mechanical. And as the personal element disappears
in the conception of the prophetic calling, so it tends to disappear
in the prophetic view of history, and the future comes to be
conceived not as the organic result of the present under the
divine guidance, but as mechanically determined from the
beginning in the counsels of God, and arranged under artificial
categories of time. This is essentially the apocalyptic conception
of history, and Ezekiel may be justly represented as in certain
essential aspects its founder in Israel.</p>

<p>We shall now consider (I.) Apocalyptic, its origin and general
characteristics; (II.) Old Testament Apocalyptic; (III.) New
Testament Apocalyptic.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">I. Apocalyptic&mdash;its Origin and General Characteristics</p>

<p>i. <i>Sources of Apocalyptic.</i>&mdash;The origin of Apocalyptic is to
be sought in (<i>a</i>) unfulfilled prophecy and in (<i>b</i>) traditional
elements drawn from various sources.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The origin of Apocalyptic is to be sought in <i>unfulfilled
prophecy</i>. That certain prophecies relating to the coming
kingdom of God had clearly not been fulfilled was a matter of
religious difficulty to the returned exiles from Babylon. The
judgments predicted by the pre-exilic prophets had indeed been
executed to the letter, but where were the promised glories of
the renewed kingdom and Israel&rsquo;s unquestioned sovereignty
over the nations of the earth? One such unfulfilled prophecy
Ezekiel takes up and reinterprets in such a way as to show that
its fulfilment is still to come. The prophets Jeremiah (iv.-vi.)
and Zephaniah had foretold the invasion of Judah by a mighty
people from the north. But as this northern foe had failed to
appear Ezekiel re-edited this prophecy in a new form as a final
assault of Gog and his hosts on Jerusalem, and thus established
a permanent dogma in Jewish apocalyptic, which in due course
passed over into Christian.</p>

<p>But the non-fulfilment of prophecies relating to this or that
individual event or people served to popularize the methods of
apocalyptic in a very slight degree in comparison with the non-fulfilment
of the greatest of all prophecies&mdash;the advent of the
Messianic kingdom. Thus, though Jeremiah had promised that
after seventy years (xxv. 11., xxix. 10) Israel should be restored
to their own land (xxiv. 5, 6), and then enjoy the blessings of the
Messianic kingdom under the Messianic king (xxiii. 5, 6), this
period passed by and things remained as of old. Haggai and
Zechariah explained the delay by the failure of Judah to rebuild
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a>170</span>
the temple, and so generation after generation the hope of the
kingdom persisted, sustained most probably by ever-fresh
reinterpretations of ancient prophecy, till in the first half of the
2nd century the delay is explained in the Books of Daniel and
Enoch as due not to man&rsquo;s shortcomings but to the counsels
of God. The 70 years of Jeremiah are interpreted by the
angel in Daniel (ix. 25-27) as 70 weeks of years, of which 69½
have already expired, while the writer of Enoch (lxxxv.-xc.)
interprets the 70 years of Jeremiah as the 70 successive reigns
of the 70 angelic patrons of the nations, which are to come to
a close in his own generation.</p>

<p>But the above periods came and passed by, and again the
expectations of the Jews were disappointed. Presently the
Greek empire of the East was overthrown by Rome, and in due
course this new phenomenon, so full of meaning for the Jews,
called forth a new interpretation of Daniel. The fourth and
last empire which, according to Daniel vii. 10-25, was to be Greek,
was now declared to be Roman by the Apocalypse of Baruch
(xxxvi.-xl.) and 4 Ezra (x. 60-xii. 35). Once more such ideas
as those of &ldquo;the day of Yahweh&rdquo; and the &ldquo;new heavens and
a new earth&rdquo; were constantly re-edited with fresh nuances in
conformity with their new settings. Thus the inner development
of Jewish apocalyptic was always conditioned by the historical
experiences of the nation.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) Another source of apocalyptic was <i>primitive mythological
and cosmological traditions</i>, in which the eye of the seer could
see the secrets of the future no less surely than those of the past.
Thus the six days of the world&rsquo;s creation, followed by a seventh
of rest, were regarded as at once a history of the past and a forecasting of the future. As the world was made in six days its
history would be accomplished in six thousand years, since each
day with God was as a thousand years and a thousand years as
one day; and as the six days of creation were followed by one
of rest, so the six thousand years of the world&rsquo;s history would be
followed by a rest of a thousand years (2 Enoch xxxii. 2-xxxiii. 2).
Of primitive mythological traditions we might mention the
primeval serpent, leviathan, behemoth, while to ideas native to
or familiar in apocalyptic belong those of the seven archangels,
the angelic patrons of the nations (Deut. xxxii. 8, in LXX.; Isaiah
xxiv. 21; Dan. x. 13, 20, &amp;c.), the mountain of God in the north
(Isaiah xiv. 13; Ezek. i. 4, &amp;c.), the garden of Eden.</p>

<p>ii. <i>Object and Contents of Apocalyptic.</i>&mdash;The object of this
literature in general was to solve the difficulties connected with
the righteousness of God and the suffering condition of His
righteous servants on earth. The righteousness of God postulated
according to the law the temporal prosperity of the righteous
and the <i>temporal</i> prosperity of necessity; for as yet there was
no promise of life or recompense beyond the grave. But this
connexion was not found to obtain as a rule in life, and the
difficulties arising from this conflict between promise and
experience centred round the lot of the righteous as a community
and the lot of the righteous man as an individual. Old Testament
prophecy had addressed itself to both these problems, though it
was hardly conscious of the claims of the latter. It concerned
itself essentially with the present, and with the future only as
growing organically out of the present. It taught the absolute
need of personal and national righteousness, and foretold the
ultimate blessedness of the righteous nation on the present earth.
But its views were not systematic and comprehensive in regard
to the nations in general, while as regards the individual it held
that God&rsquo;s service here was its own and adequate reward, and
saw no need of postulating another world to set right the evils of
this. But later, with the growing claims of the individual and
the acknowledgment of these in the religious and intellectual life,
both problems, and especially the latter, pressed themselves
irresistibly on the notice of religious thinkers, and made it
impossible for any conception of the divine rule and righteousness
to gain acceptance, which did not render adequate satisfaction
to the claims of both problems. To render such satisfaction was
the task undertaken by apocalyptic, as well as to vindicate the
righteousness of God alike in respect of the individual and of the
nation. To justify their contention they sketched in outline
the history of the world and mankind, the origin of evil and its
course, and the final consummation of all things. Thus they
presented in fact a theodicy, a rudimentary philosophy of religion.
The righteous as a nation should yet possess the earth, even in
this world the faithful community should attain its rights in an
eternal Messianic kingdom on earth, or else in temporary blessedness
here and eternal blessedness hereafter. So far as regards
the righteous community. It was, however, in regard to the
destiny of the individual that apocalyptic rendered its chief
service. Though the individual might perish amid the disorders
of this world, he would not fail, apocalyptic taught, to attain
through resurrection the recompense that was his due in the
Messianic kingdom or in heaven itself. Apocalyptic thus forms
the indispensable preparation for the religion of the New
Testament.</p>

<p>iii. <i>Form of Apocalyptic.</i>&mdash;The form of apocalyptic is a literary
form; for we cannot suppose that the writers experienced the
voluminous and detailed visions we find in their books. On the
other hand the reality of the visions is to some extent guaranteed
by the writer&rsquo;s intense earnestness and by his manifest belief
in the divine origin of his message. But the difficulty of regarding
the visions as actual experiences, or as in any sense actual, is
intensified, when full account is taken of the artifices of the
writer; for the major part of his visions consists of what is to
him really past history dressed up in the guise of prediction.
Moreover, the writer no doubt intended that his reader should
take the accuracy of the prediction (?) already accomplished
to be a guarantee for the accuracy of that which was still unrealized.
How, then, it may well be asked, can this be consistent
with reality of visionary experience? Are we not here obliged
to assume that the visions are a literary invention and nothing
more?</p>

<p>However we may explain the inconsistency, we are precluded
by the moral earnestness of the writer from assuming the visions
to be pure inventions. But the inconsistency has in part been
explained by Gunkel, who has rightly emphasized that the
writer did not freely invent his materials but derived them in
the main from tradition, as he held that these mysterious traditions
of his people were, if rightly expounded, forecasts of the
time to come. Furthermore, the visionary who is found at most
periods of great spiritual excitement was forced by the prejudice
of his time, which refused to acknowledge any inspiration in the
present, to ascribe his visionary experiences and reinterpretations
of the mysterious traditions of his people to some heroic figure
of the past. Moreover, there will always be a difficulty in determining
what belongs to his actual vision and what to the literary
skill or free invention of the author, seeing that the visionary
must be dependent on memory and past experience for the forms
and much of the matter of the actual vision.</p>

<p>iv. <i>Apocalyptic as distinguished from Prophecy.</i>&mdash;We have
already dwelt on certain notable differences between apocalyptic
and prophecy; but there are certain others that call for attention.</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) <i>In the Nature of its Message.</i>&mdash;The message of the prophets
was primarily a preaching of repentance and righteousness if the
nation would escape judgment; the message of the apocalyptic
writers was of patience and trust for that deliverance and reward
were sure to come.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <i>By its dualistic Theology.</i>&mdash;Prophecy believes that this
world is God&rsquo;s world and that in this world His goodness and
truth will yet be vindicated. Hence the prophet prophesies of
a definite future arising out of and organically connected with
the present. The apocalyptic writer on the other hand despairs
of the present, and directs his hopes absolutely to the future, to
a new world standing in essential opposition to the present.
(<i>Non fecit Altissimus unum saeculum sed duo</i>, 4 Ezra vii. 50.)
Here we have essentially a dualistic principle, which, though it
can largely be accounted for by the interaction of certain inner
tendencies and outward sorrowful experience on the part of
Judaism, may ultimately be derived from Mazdean influences.
This principle, which shows itself clearly at first in the conception
that the various nations are under angelic rulers, who are in a
greater or less degree in rebellion against God, as in Daniel and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a>171</span>
Enoch, grows in strength with each succeeding age, till at last
Satan is conceived as &ldquo;the ruler of this world&rdquo; (John xii. 31)
or &ldquo;the god of this age&rdquo; (2 Cor. iv. 4). Under the guidance
of such a principle the writer naturally expected the world&rsquo;s
culmination in evil to be the immediate precursor of God&rsquo;s
intervention on behalf of the righteous, and every fresh growth
in evil to be an additional sign that the time was at hand. The
natural concomitant in conduct of such a belief is an
uncompromising asceticism. He that would live to the next world
must shun this. Visions are vouchsafed only to those who to
prayer have added fasting.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <i>By pseudonymous Authorship.</i>&mdash;We have already touched
on this characteristic of apocalyptic. The prophet stood in
direct relations with his people; his prophecy was first spoken
and afterwards written. The apocalyptic writer could obtain
no hearing from his contemporaries, who held that, though God
spoke in the past, &ldquo;there was no more any prophet.&rdquo; This
pessimism and want of faith limited and defined the form in
which religious enthusiasm should manifest itself, and prescribed
as a condition of successful effort the adoption of pseudonymous
authorship. The apocalyptic writer, therefore, professedly
addressed his book to future generations. Generally directions
as to the hiding and sealing of the book (Dan. xii. 4, 9; 1 Enoch
i. 4; Ass. Mos. i. 16-18) were given in the text in order to explain
its publication so long after the date of its professed period.
Moreover, there was a sense in which such books were not
wholly pseudonymous. Their writers were students of ancient
prophecy and apocalyptical tradition, and, though they might
recast and reinterpret them, they could not regard them as
their own inventions. Each fresh apocalypse would in the
eyes of its writer be in some degree but a fresh edition of the
traditions naturally attaching themselves to great names in
Israel&rsquo;s past, and thus the books named respectively Enoch,
Noah, Ezra would to some slight extent be not pseudonymous.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>By its comprehensive and deterministic Conception of
History.</i>&mdash;Apocalyptic took an indefinitely wider view of the
world&rsquo;s history than prophecy. Thus, whereas prophecy had
to deal with temporary reverses at the hands of some heathen
power, apocalyptic arose at a time when Israel had been subject
for generations to the sway of one or other of the great world-powers.
Hence to harmonize such difficulties with belief in
God&rsquo;s righteousness, it had to take account of the rôle of such
empires in the counsels of God, the rise, duration and downfall
of each in turn, till finally the lordship of the world passed into
the hands of Israel, or the final judgment arrived. These events
belonged in the main to the past, but the writer represented
them as still in the future, arranged under certain artificial
categories of time definitely determined from the beginning in
the counsels of God and revealed by Him to His servants the
prophets. Determinism thus became a leading characteristic of
Jewish apocalyptic, and its conception of history became severely
mechanical.</p>

<p><i>Book of Noah.</i>&mdash;Though this book has not come down to us
independently, it has in large measure been incorporated in
the Ethiopic Book of Enoch, and can in part be reconstructed
from it. The Book of Noah is mentioned in Jubilees x. 13, xxi. 10.
Chapters lx., lxv.-lxix. 25 of the Ethiopic Enoch are without
question derived from it. Thus lx. 1 runs: &ldquo;In the year 500, in
the seventh month ... in the life of Enoch.&rdquo; Here the editor
simply changed the name Noah in the context before him into
Enoch, for the statement is based on Gen. v. 32, and Enoch
lived only 365 years. Chapters vi.-xi. are clearly from the same
source; for they make no reference to Enoch, but bring forward
Noah (x. 1) and treat of the sin of the angels that led to the
flood, and of their temporal and eternal punishment. This
section is compounded of the Semjaza and Azazel myths, and
in its present composite form is already presupposed by 1 Enoch
lxxxviii.-xc. Hence these chapters are earlier than 166 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>
Chapters cvi.-cvii. of the same book are probably from the same
source; likewise liv. 7-lv. 2, and Jubilees vii. 20-39, x. 1-15.
In the former passage of Jubilees the subject-matter leads to
this identification, as well as the fact that Noah is represented
as speaking in the first person, although throughout Jubilees it
is the angel that speaks. Possibly Eth. En. xli. 3-8, xliii.-xliv.,
lix. are from the same work. The book may have opened with
Eth. En. cvi.-cvii. On these chapters may have followed Eth.
En. vi.-xi., lxv.-lxix. 25, lx., xli. 3-8, xliii.-xliv., liv. 7-lv. 2;
Jubilees vii. 26-39, x. 1-15.</p>

<p>The Hebrew Book of Noah, a later work, is printed in Jellinek&rsquo;s
<i>Bet ha-Midrasch</i>, iii. 155-156, and translated into German in
Rönsch, <i>Das Buch der Jubiläen</i>, 385-387. It is based on the part
of the above Book of Noah which is preserved in the <i>Book of
Jubilees</i>. The portion of this Hebrew work which is derived
from the older work is reprinted in Charles&rsquo;s <i>Ethiopic Version
of the Hebrew Book of Jubilees</i>, p. 179.</p>

<p><i>1 Enoch, or the Ethiopic Book of Enoch.</i>&mdash;This is the most
important of all the apocryphal writings for the history of
religious thought. Like the Pentateuch, the Psalms, the Megilloth
and the Pirke Aboth, this work was divided into five parts,
which, as we shall notice presently, spring from five different
sources. Originally written partly in Aramaic (<i>i.e.</i> vi.-xxxvi.) and
partly in Hebrew (i.-vi., xxxvii.-cviii.), it was translated into
Greek, and from Greek into Ethiopic and possibly Latin. Only
one-fifth of the Greek version in two forms survives. The various
elements of the book were written by different authors at different
dates, vi.-xxxvi. was written before 166 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, lxxii.-lxxxii.
before the <i>Book of Jubilees</i>, <i>i.e.</i> before 120 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> or thereabouts,
lxxxiii.-xc. about 166 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, i.-v., xci.-civ. before 95 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>, and
xxxvii.-lxxi. before 64 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> There are many interpolations
drawn mainly from the Book of Noah.</p>

<p><i>Testaments of the XII. Patriarchs.</i>&mdash;This book, in some respects
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a>172</span>
the most important of Old Testament apocryphs, has only
recently come into its own. Till a few years ago, owing to
Christian interpolations, it was taken to be a Christian apocryph,
written originally in Greek in the 2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> Now it is
acknowledged by Christian and Jewish scholars alike to have
been written in Hebrew in the 2nd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> From Hebrew
it was translated into Greek and from Greek into Armenian and
Slavonic. The versions have come down in their entirety, and
small portions of the Hebrew text have been recovered from
later Jewish writings. The Testaments were written about the
same date as the <i>Book of Jubilees</i>. These two books form the
only Apology in Jewish literature for the religious and civil
hegemony of the Maccabees from the Pharisaic standpoint.
To the Jewish interpolation of the 1st century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> (about 60-40),
<i>i.e.</i> T. Lev. x., xiv.-xvi.; T. Jud. xxii.-xxiii., &amp;c., a large
interest attaches; for these, like I Enoch xci.-civ. and the Psalms
of Solomon, constitute an unmeasured attack on every office&mdash;
prophetic, priestly and kingly&mdash;administered by the Maccabees.
The ethical character of the book is of the highest type, and its
profound influence on the writers of the New Testament is yet
to be appreciated. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Testaments of the XII. Patriarchs</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Psalms of Solomon.</i>&mdash;These psalms, in all eighteen, enjoyed
but small consideration in early times, for only six direct references
to them are found in early literature. Their ascription to
Solomon is due solely to the copyists or translators, for no such
claim is made in any of the psalms. On the whole, Ryle and
James are no doubt right in assigning 70-40 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> as the limits
within which the psalms were written. The authors were
Pharisees. They divide their countrymen into two classes&mdash;
&ldquo;the righteous,&rdquo; ii. 38-39, iii. 3-5, 7, 8, &amp;c., and &ldquo;the sinners,&rdquo;
ii. 38, iii. 13, iv. 9, &amp;c.; &ldquo;the saints,&rdquo; iii. 10, &amp;c., and &ldquo;the
transgressors,&rdquo; iv. II, &amp;c. The former are the Pharisees; the
latter the Sadducees. They protest against the Asmonaean
house for usurping the throne of David, and laying violent hands
on the high priesthood (xvii. 5, 6, 8), and proclaim the coming of
the Messiah, the Son of David, who is to set all things right and
establish the supremacy of Israel. Pss. xvii.-xviii. and i.-xvi.
cannot be assigned to the same authorship. The hopes of the
Messiah are confined to the former, and a somewhat different
eschatology underlies the two works. Since the Psalms were
written in Hebrew, and intended for public worship in the
synagogues, it is most probable that they were composed in
Palestine. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Solomon, The Psalms of</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>The Assumption of Moses</i>.&mdash;This book was lost for many centuries
till a large fragment of it was discovered by
Ceriani in 1861 (<i>Monumenta Sacra</i>, I. i. 55-64) from a palimpsest
of the 6th century. Very little was known about the contents
of this book prior to this discovery. The present book is possibly
the long-lost <span class="grk" title="Diathêke Mouseos">&#916;&#953;&#945;&#952;&#942;&#954;&#951; &#924;&#969;&#965;&#963;&#941;&#969;&#962;</span> mentioned in some ancient
lists, for it never speaks of the assumption of Moses, but always
of his natural death. About a half of the original Testament is
preserved in the Latin version. The latter half probably dealt
with questions about the creation. With this &ldquo;Testament&rdquo;
the &ldquo;Assumption,&rdquo; to which almost all the patristic references
and that of Jude are made, was subsequently edited. The book
was written between 4 <span class="scs">B.C.</span> and <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 7. As for the author, he
was no Essene, for he recognizes animal sacrifices and cherishes
the Messianic hope; he was not a Sadducee, for he looks forward
to the establishment of the Messianic kingdom (x.); nor a Zealot,
for the quietistic ideal is upheld (ix.), and the kingdom is established
by God Himself (x.). He is therefore a Chasid of the
ancient type, and glorifies the ideals which were cherished by
the old Pharisaic party, but which were now being fast disowned
in favour of a more active role in the political life of the nation.
He pours his most scathing invectives on the Sadducees, who
are described in vii. in terms that recall the anti-Sadducean
Psalms of Solomon. His object, therefore, is to protest against
the growing secularization of the Pharisaic party through its
adoption of popular Messianic beliefs and political ideals. (See
also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Moses, Assumption of</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Apocalypse of Baruch&mdash;The Syriac.</i>&mdash;This apocalypse has
survived only in the Syriac version. The Syriac is a translation
from the Greek, and the Greek in turn from the Hebrew. The
book treats of the Messiah and the Messianic kingdom, the woes
of Israel in the past and the destruction of Jerusalem in the
present, as well as of theological questions relating to original
sin, free will, works, &amp;c. The views expressed on several of
these subjects are often conflicting. We must, therefore,
assume a number of independent sources put together by
an editor or else that the book is on the whole the work of
one author who made use of independent writings but failed
to blend them into one harmonious whole. In its present form
the book was written soon after <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 70. For fuller treatment
see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Baruch</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>4 Ezra.</i>&mdash;This apocryph is variously named. In the first
Arabic and Ethiopic versions it is called I Ezra; in some Latin
MSS. and in the English authorized version it is 2 Ezra, and in
the Armenian 3 Ezra. With the majority of the Latin MSS. we
designate the book 4 Ezra. In its fullest form this apocryph
consists of sixteen chapters, but i.-ii. and xv.-xvi. are of different
authorship from each other and from the main work iii.-xiv.
The book was written originally in Hebrew. There are Latin,
Syriac, Ethiopic, Arabic (two), and Armenian versions. The
Greek version is lost. This apocalypse is of very great importance,
on account of its very full treatment of the theological
questions rife in the latter half of the 1st century of the Christian
era. The book, even if written by one author, was based on a
variety of already existing works. It springs from the same
school of thought as the <i>Apocalypse of Baruch</i>, and its affinities
with the latter are so numerous and profound that scholars have
not yet come to any consensus as to the relative priority of either.
In its present form it was composed <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 80-100. For fuller
treatment see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Ezra</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Apocalypse of Baruch&mdash;The Greek.</i>&mdash;This work is referred to
by Origen (<i>de Princip.</i> II. iii. 6): &ldquo;Denique etiam Baruch
prophetae librum in assertionis hujus&rsquo; testimonium vocant, quod
ibi de septem mundis vel caelis evidentius indicatur.&rdquo; This
book survives in two forms in Slavonic and Greek. The former
was translated by Bonwetsch in 1896, in the <i>Nachrichten von
der königl. Ges. der Wiss. zu, Gött</i>. pp. 91-101; the latter by
James in 1897 in <i>Anecdota</i>, ii. 84-94, with an elaborate introduction
(pp. li.-lxxi.). The Slavonic is only of secondary value,
as it is merely an abbreviated form of the Greek. Even the
Greek cannot claim to be the original work, but only to be a
recension of it; for, whereas Origen states that this apocalypse
contained an account of the seven heavens, the existing Greek
work describes only five, and the Slavonic only two. As the
original, work presupposes 2 Enoch and the Syriac <i>Apocalypse of
Baruch</i> and was known to Origen, it was written between
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 80 and 200, and nearer the earlier date than the later, as it
would otherwise be hard to understand how it came to circulate
among Christians. The superscription shows points of connexion
with the <i>Rest of the Words of Baruch</i>, but little weight
can be attached to the fact, since titles and superscriptions
were so frequently transformed and expanded in ancient times.
As James and Kohler have pointed out, part of section 4 on the
Vine is a Christian addition. A German translation of the Greek
appears in Kautzsch&rsquo;s <i>Apok. u. Pseud</i>, ii. 448-457, and a strong
article by Kohler on the Jewish authorship of the book in
the <i>Jewish Encyclopedia</i>, ii. 549-551. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Baruch</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Apocalypse of Abraham.</i>&mdash;This book is found only in the
Slavonic (edited by Bonwetsch, <i>Studien zur Geschichte d. Theologie
und Kirche</i>, 1897), a translation from the Greek. It is of
Jewish origin, but in part worked over by a Christian reviser.
The first part treats of Abraham&rsquo;s conversion, and the second
forms an apocalyptic expansion of Gen. xv. This book was
possibly known to the author of the <i>Clem. Recognitions</i>, i. 32,
a passage, however, which may refer to Jubilees. It is most
probably distinct from the <span class="grk" title="Apokalepsis Abraam">&#902;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#940;&#955;&#965;&#968;&#953;&#962; &#902;&#946;&#961;&#945;&#940;&#956;</span> used by the
gnostic Sethites (Epiphanius, <i>Haer</i>. xxxix. 5), which was very
heretical. On the other hand, it is probably identical with the
apocryphal book <span class="grk" title="Abraam">&#902;&#946;&#961;&#945;&#940;&#956;</span> mentioned in the Stichometry of
Nicephorus, and the Synopsis Athanasii, together with the
Apocalypses of Enoch, &amp;c.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page173" id="page173"></a>173</span></p>

<p><i>Lost Apocalypses: Prayer of Joseph.</i>&mdash;The <i>Prayer of Joseph</i>
is quoted by Origen [<i>In Joann.</i> II. xxv, (Lommatzsch, i. 147,
148); <i>in Gen.</i> III. ix. (Lommatzsch, viii. 30-31)]. The fragments
in Origen represent Jacob as speaking and claiming to be &ldquo;the
first servant in God&rsquo;s presence,&rdquo; &ldquo;the first-begotten of every
creature animated by God,&rdquo; and declaring that the angel who
wrestled with Jacob (and was identified by Christians with
Christ) was only eighth in rank. The work was obviously
anti-Christian. (See Schürer<span class="sp">3</span>, iii. 265-266.)</p>

<p><i>Book of Eldad and Modad.</i>&mdash;This book was written in the
name of the two prophets mentioned in Num. xi. 26-29. It
consisted, according to the Targ. Jon. on Num. xi. 26-20, mainly
of prophecies on Magog&rsquo;s last attack on Israel. The Shepherd
of Hermas quotes it <i>Vis.</i> ii. 3. (See Marshall in Hastings&rsquo; <i>Bible Dictionary</i>, i. 677.)</p>

<p><i>Apocalypse of Elijah.</i>&mdash;This apocalypse is mentioned in two
of the lists of books. Origen, Ambrosiaster, and Euthalius
ascribe to it I Cor. ii. 9. If they are right, the apocalypse is
pre-Pauline. The peculiar form in which I Cor. ii. 9 appears
in Clemens Alex. <i>Protrept.</i> x. 94, and the <i>Const. Apost.</i> vii. 32,
shows that both have the same source, probably this apocalypse.
Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i> xlii., ed. Oehler, vol. ii. 678) ascribes to this
work Eph. v. 14. Isr. Lévi (<i>Revue des études juives</i>, 1880, i.
108 sqq.) argues for the existence of a Hebrew apocalypse of
Elijah from two Talmudic passages. A late work of this name
has been published by Jellinek, <i>Bet ha-Midrasch</i>, 1855, iii. 65-68,
and Buttenwieser in 1897. Zahn, <i>Gesch. des N.T. Kanons</i>, ii. 801-810,
assigns this apocalypse to the 2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span> (See
Schürer<span class="sp">3</span>, iii. 267-271.)</p>

<p><i>Apocalypse of Zephaniah.</i>&mdash;Apart from two of the lists this
work is known to us in its original form only through a citation
in Clem. Alex. <i>Strom.</i> v. II, 77. A Christian revision of it is
probably preserved in the two dialects of Coptic. Of these the
Akhmim text is the original of the Sahidic. These texts and
their translations have been edited by Steindorff, <i>Die Apokalypse
des Elias, eine unbekannte Apokalypse und Bruchstucke der
Sophonias-Apokalypse</i> (1809). As Schürer (<i>Theol. Literaturzeitung</i>,
1899, No. I. 4-8) has shown, these fragments belong
most probably to the Zephaniah apocalypse. They give descriptions
of heaven and hell, and predictions of the Antichrist. In
their present form these Christianized fragments are not earlier
than the 3rd century. (See Schürer, <i>Gesch. des jüd. Volkes</i><span class="sp">3</span>,
iii. 271-273.)</p>

<p>2 <i>Enoch</i>, or the <i>Slavonic Enoch</i>, or the <i>Book of the Secrets of
Enoch.</i>&mdash;This new fragment of the Enochic literature was recently
brought to light through five MSS. discovered in Russia and
Servia. The book in its present form was written before <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 70
in Greek by an orthodox Hellenistic Jew, who lived in Egypt.
For a fuller account see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Enoch</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Oracles of Hystaspes.</i>&mdash;See under <i>N. T. Apocalypses</i>, below.</p>

<p><i>Testament of Job.</i>&mdash;This book was first printed from one MS.
by Mai, <i>Script. Vet. Nov. Coll.</i> (1833), VII. i. 180, and translated
into French in Migne&rsquo;s <i>Dict. des Apocryphes</i>, ii. 403. An
excellent edition from two MSS. is given by M.R. James,
<i>Apocrypha Anecdota</i>, ii. pp. lxxii.-cii., 104-137, who holds that the
book in its present form was written by a Christian Jew in Egypt
on the basis of a Hebrew Midrash on Job in the 2nd or 3rd century
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> Kohler (<i>Kohut Memorial Volume</i>, 1897, pp. 264-338)
has given good grounds for regarding the whole work, with the
exception of some interpolations, as &ldquo;one of the most remarkable
productions of the pre-Christian era, explicable only when
viewed in the light of Hasidean practice.&rdquo; See <i>Jewish Encycl.</i>
vii. 200-202.</p>

<p><i>Testaments of the III. Patriarchs.</i>&mdash;For an account of these
three Testaments (referred to in the <i>Apost. Const.</i> vi. 16), the
first of which only is preserved in the Greek and is assigned by
James to the 2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, see that scholar&rsquo;s &ldquo;Testament of
Abraham,&rdquo; <i>Texts and Studies</i>, ii. 2 (1892), which appears in two
recensions from six and three MSS. respectively, and Vassiliev&rsquo;s
<i>Anecdota Graeco-Byzantina</i>, (1893), pp. 292-308, from one MS.
already used by James. This work was written in Egypt,
according to James, and survives also in Slavonic, Rumanian,
Ethiopic, and Arabic versions. It deals with Abraham&rsquo;s reluctance
to die and the means by which his death was brought
about. James holds that this book is referred to by Origen
(<i>Hom. in Luc.</i> xxxv.), but this is denied by Schürer, who also
questions its Jewish origin. With the exception of chaps. x.-xi.,
it is really a legend and not an apocalypse. An English translation
of James&rsquo;s texts will be found in the <i>Ante-Nicene Christian
Library</i> (Clark, 1897), pp. 185-201. The Testaments of Isaac
and Jacob are still preserved in Arabic and Ethiopic (see James,
<i>op. cit.</i> 140-161). See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Testaments of the III. Patriarchs</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Sibylline Oracles.</i>&mdash;Of the books which have come down to us
the main part is Jewish, and was written at various dates,
iii. 97-829, iv.-v. are decidedly of Jewish authorship, and
probably xi.-xii., xiv. and parts of i.-ii. The oldest portions are
in iii., and belong to the 2nd century <span class="scs">B.C.</span></p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">III. New Testament Apocalyptic</p>

<p>When we pass from Jewish literature to that of the New
Testament, we enter into a new and larger atmosphere at once
recalling and transcending what had been best in the prophetic
periods of the past. Again the heavens had opened and the
divine teaching come to mankind, no longer merely in books
bearing the names of ancient patriarchs, but on the lips of
living men, who had taken courage to appear in person as God&rsquo;s
messengers before His people. But though Christianity was in
spirit the descendant of ancient Jewish prophecy, it was no less
truly the child of that Judaism which had expressed its highest
aspirations and ideals in pseudepigraphic and apocalyptic
literature. Hence we shall not be surprised to find that the
two tendencies are fully represented in primitive Christianity,
and, still more strange as it may appear, that New Testament
apocalyptic found a more ready hearing amid the stress and
storm of the 1st century than the prophetic side of Christianity,
and that the type of the forerunner on the side of its declared
asceticism appealed more readily to primitive Christianity than
that of Him who came &ldquo;eating and drinking,&rdquo; declaring both
worlds good and both God&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>Early Christianity had thus naturally a special fondness for
this class of literature. It was Christianity that preserved Jewish
apocalyptic, when it was abandoned by Judaism as it sank into
Rabbinism, and gave it a Christian character either by a forcible
exegesis or by a systematic process of interpolation. Moreover,
it cultivated this form of literature and made it the vehicle of
its own ideas. Though apocalyptic served its purpose in the
opening centuries of the Christian era, it must be confessed that
in <i>many</i> of its aspects its office is transitory, as they belong not
to the essence of Christian thought. When once it had taught
men that the next world was God&rsquo;s world, though it did so at
the cost of relinquishing the present to Satan, it had achieved
its real task, and the time had come for it to quit the stage of
history, when Christianity appeared as the heir of this true
spiritual achievement. But Christianity was no less assuredly
the heir of ancient prophecy, and thus as spiritual representative
of what was true in prophecy and apocalyptic; its essential
teaching was as that of its Founder that both worlds were of God
and that both should be made God&rsquo;s.</p>

<p><i>Apocalypse in Mark xiii.</i>&mdash;According to the teaching of the
Gospels the second advent was to take the world by surprise.
Only one passage (Mark xiii. = Matt. xxiv. = Luke xxi.) conflicts
with this view, and is therefore suspicious. This represents the
second advent as heralded by a succession of signs which are
unmistakable precursors of its appearance, such as wars, earthquakes,
famines, the destruction of Jerusalem and the like. Our
suspicion is justified by a further examination of Mark xiii. For
the words &ldquo;let him that <i>readeth</i> understand&rdquo; (ver. 14) indicate
that the prediction referred to appeared first not in a spoken address
but in a written form, as was characteristic of apocalypses.
Again, in ver. 30, it is declared that this generation shall not pass
away until all these things be fulfilled, whereas in 32 we have
an undoubted declaration of Christ &ldquo;Of that day or of that hour
knoweth no one, not even the angels in heaven, neither the Son,
but the Father.&rdquo; On these and other grounds verses 7, 8, 14-20,
24-27, 30, 31 should be removed from their present context.
Taken together they constitute a Christian adaptation of an
originally Jewish work, written <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 67-68, during the troubles
preceding the fall of Jerusalem. The apocalypse consists of
three Acts: Act i. consisting of verses 7, 8, enumerating the
woes heralding the parusia, Act ii. describing the actual tribulation,
and Act iii. the parusia itself. (See Wendt, <i>Lehre Jesu</i>, i.
12-21; Charles, <i>Eschatology</i>, 325 sqq.; H.S. Holtzmann,
<i>N. T. Theol.</i> 1-325 sqq. with literature there given.)</p>

<p><i>2 Thessalonians ii.</i>&mdash;The earliest form of Pauline eschatology
is essentially Jewish. He starts from the fundamental thought
of Jewish apocalyptic that the end of the world will be brought
about by the direct intervention of God when evil has reached
its climax. The manifestation of evil culminates in the Antichrist
whose parusia (2 Thess. ii. 9) is the Satanic counterfeit of
that of the true Messiah. But the climax of evil is the immediate
herald of its destruction; for thereupon Christ will descend from
heaven and destroy the Antichrist (ii. 8). Nowhere in his later
epistles does this forecast of the future reappear. Rather under
the influence of the great formative Christian conceptions he
parted gradually with the eschatology he had inherited from
Judaism, and entered on a progressive development, in the course
of which the heterogeneous elements were for the most part
silently dropped.</p>

<p><i>Revelation.</i>&mdash;Since this book is discussed separately we shall
content ourselves here with indicating a few of the conclusions
now generally accepted. The apocalypse was written about
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 96. Its object, like other Jewish apocalypses, was to encourage
faith under persecution; its burden is not a call to
repentance but a promise of deliverance. It is derived from
one author, who has made free use of a variety of elements,
some of which are Jewish and consort but ill with their new
context. The question of the pseudonymity of the book is still
an open one.</p>

<p><i>Apocalypse of Peter.</i>&mdash;Till 1892 only some five or more fragments
of this book were known to exist. These are preserved
in Clem. Alex. and in Macarius Magnes (see Hilgenfeld, <i>N.T.
extra Can.</i> iv. 74 sqq.; Zahn, <i>Gesch. Kanons</i> ii. 818-819). It is
mentioned in the Muratorian Canon, and according to Eusebius
(<i>H.E.</i> vi. 14. i) was commented on by Clement of Alexandria.
In the fragment found at Akhmim there is a prediction of the
last things, and a vision of the abode and blessedness of the
righteous, and of the abode and torments of the wicked.</p>

<p><i>Testament of Hezekiah.</i>&mdash;This writing is fragmentary, and has
been preserved merely as a constituent of the Ascension of
Isaiah. To it belongs iii. 13b-iv. 18 of that book. It is found
under the above name, <span class="grk" title="Diathêkê Ezekion">&#916;&#953;&#945;&#952;&#942;&#954;&#951; &#904;&#950;&#949;&#954;&#943;&#959;&#965;</span>, only in Cedrenus i. 120-121,
who quotes partially iv. 12. 14 and refers to iv. 15-18. For
a full account see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Isaiah, Ascension of</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Testament of Abraham.</i>&mdash;This work in two recensions was
first published by James, <i>Texts and Studies</i>, ii. 2. Its editor is
of opinion that it was written by a Jewish Christian in Egypt
in the 2nd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span>, but that it embodies legends of an earlier
date, and that it received its present form in the 9th or 10th
century. It treats of Michael being sent to announce to Abraham
his death: of the tree speaking with a human voice (iii.), Michael&rsquo;s
sojourn with Abraham (iv.-v.) and Sarah&rsquo;s recognition of him as
one of the three angels, Abraham&rsquo;s refusal to die (vii.), and the
vision of judgment (x.-xx.).</p>

<p><i>Oracles of Hystaspes.</i>&mdash;This eschatological work (<span class="grk" title="Chrêseis
Hystaspon">&#935;&#961;&#942;&#963;&#949;&#953;&#962; &#910;&#963;&#964;&#940;&#963;&#960;&#959;&#965;</span>: so named by the anonymous 5th-century writer in
Buresch, <i>Klaros</i>, 1889, p. 95) is mentioned in conjunction with
the Sibyllines by Justin (<i>Apol.</i> i. 20), Clement of Alexandria
(<i>Strom.</i> vi. 5), and Lactantius (<i>Inst.</i> VII. xv. 19; xviii. 2-3).
According to Lactantius, it prophesied the overthrow of Rome
and the advent of Zeus to help the godly and destroy the wicked,
but omitted all reference to the sending of the Son of God.
According to Justin, it prophesied the destruction of the world
by fire. According to the <i>Apocryph of Paul</i>, cited by Clement,
Hystaspes foretold the conflict of the Messiah with many kings
and His advent. Finally, an unknown 5th-century writer (see
Buresch, <i>Klaros</i>, 1889, pp. 87-126) says that the <i>Oracles of
Hystaspes</i> dealt with the incarnation of the Saviour. The work
referred to in the last two writers has Christian elements, which
were absent from it in Lactantius&rsquo;s copy. The lost oracles were
therefore in all probability originally Jewish, and subsequently
re-edited by a Christian.</p>

<p><i>Vision of Isaiah.</i>&mdash;This writing has been preserved in its
entirety in the <i>Ascension of Isaiah</i>, of which it constitutes
chaps, vi.-xi. Before its incorporation in the latter work it
circulated independently in Greek. There are independent
versions of these chapters in Latin and Slavonic. (See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Isaiah,
Ascension of</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Shepherd of Hermas.</i>&mdash;In the latter half of the 2nd century
this book enjoyed a respect bordering on that paid to the writings
of the New Testament. Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria and
Origen quote it as Scripture, though in Africa it was not held in
such high consideration, as Tertullian speaks slightingly of it. The
writer belongs really to the prophetic and not to the apocalyptic
school. His book is divided into three parts containing visions,
commands, similitudes. In incidental allusions he lets us know
that he had been engaged in trade, that his wife was a termagant,
and that his children were ill brought up. Various views have
been held as to the identity of the author. Thus some have
made him out to be the Hermas to whom salutation is sent at
the end of the Epistle to the Romans, others that he was the
brother of Pius, bishop of Rome in the middle of the 2nd century,
and others that he was a contemporary of Clement, bishop of
Rome at the close of the ist century. Zahn fixes the date at 97,
Salmon a few years later, Lipsius 142. The literature of this
book (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Hermas, Shepherd of</a></span>) is very extensive. Among
the chief editions are those of Zahn, <i>Der Hirt des Hermas</i> (1868);
Gebhardt and Harnack, <i>Patres Apostolici</i> (1877, with full bibliographical
material); Funk, <i>Patres Apost.</i> (1878). Further see
Harnack, <i>Gesch. d. altchristl. Literatur</i>, i. 49-58; II. i. 257-267,
437 f.</p>

<p><i>5 Ezra.</i>&mdash;This book, which constitutes in the later MSS. the
first two chapters to 4 Ezra, falls obviously into two parts. The
first (i. 5-ii. 9) contains a strong attack on the Jews whom it
regards as the people of God; the second (ii. 10-47) addresses
itself to the Christians as God&rsquo;s people and promises them the
heavenly kingdom. It is not improbable that these chapters are
based on an earlier Jewish writing. In its present form it may
have been written before <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 200, though James and other
scholars assign it to the 3rd century. Its tone is strongly
anti-Jewish. The style is very vigorous and the materials of
a strongly apocalyptic character. See Hilgenfeld, <i>Messias
Judaeorum</i> (1869); James in Bensly&rsquo;s edition of 4 Ezra, pp.
xxxviii.-lxxx.; Weinel in Hennecke&rsquo;s <i>N.T. Apokryphen</i>, 331-336.</p>

<p><i>6 Ezra.</i>&mdash;This work consists of chapters xv.-xvi. of 4 Ezra.
It may have been written as an appendix to 4 Ezra, as it has no
proper introduction. Its contents relate to the destruction of
the world through war and natural catastrophes&mdash;for the heathen
a source of menace and fear, but for the persecuted people of God
one of admonition and comfort. There is nothing specifically
Christian in the book, which represents a persecution which
extends over the whole eastern part of the Empire. Moreover,
the idiom is particularly Semitic. Thus we have xv. 8 <i>nec</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page175" id="page175"></a>175</span>
<i>sustinebo in his quae inique exercent</i>, that is <span title="nasa be">&#1489; &#1488;&#1513;&#1504;</span>: in 9 <i>vindicans
vindicabo</i>: in 22 <i>non parcet dextera mea super peccatores</i> =
<span class="grk" title="pheisetai">&#966;&#949;&#943;&#963;&#949;&#964;&#945;&#953;</span> ... <span class="grk" title="epi">&#7952;&#960;&#943;</span> = <span title="al">&#1500;&#1506;</span> ... <span title="yahmol">&#1500;&#1493;&#1502;&#1495;&#1497;</span>. In verses 9, 19 the manifest
corruptions may be explicable from a Semitic background.
There are other Hebraisms in the text. It is true that these
might have been due to the writer&rsquo;s borrowings from earlier
Greek works ultimately of Hebrew origin. The date of the book
is also quite uncertain, though several scholars have ascribed it
to the 3rd century.</p>

<p><i>Christian Sibyllines.</i>&mdash;Critics are still at variance as to the
extent of the Christian Sibyllines. It is practically agreed that
vi.-viii. are of Christian origin. As for i.-ii., xi.-xiv. most writers
are in favour of Christian authorship; but not so Geffcken (ed.
<i>Sibyll.</i>, 1902), who strongly insists on the Jewish origin of large
sections of these books.</p>

<p><i>Apocalypses of Paul, Thomas and Stephen.</i>&mdash;These are mentioned
in the Gelasian decree. The first may possibly be the
<span class="grk" title="Anabagikon Paulou">&#902;&#957;&#945;&#946;&#945;&#964;&#953;&#954;&#8056;&#957; &#928;&#945;&#973;&#955;&#959;&#965;</span> mentioned by Epiphanius (<i>Haer</i>. xxxviii. 2)
as current among the Cainites. It is not to be confounded with
the apocalypse mentioned two sections later.</p>

<p><i>Apocalypse of Esdras.</i>&mdash;This Greek production resembles the
more ancient fourth book of Esdras in some respects. The
prophet is perplexed about the mysteries of life, and questions
God respecting them. The punishment of the wicked especially
occupies his thoughts. Since they have sinned in consequence
of Adam&rsquo;s fall, their fate is considered worse than that of the
irrational creation. The description of the tortures suffered in
the infernal regions is tolerably minute. At last the prophet
consents to give up his spirit to God, who has prepared for him
a crown of immortality. The book is a poor imitation of the
ancient Jewish one. It may belong, however, to the 2nd or 3rd
centuries of the Christian era. See Tischendorf, <i>Apocalypses
Apocryphae</i>, pp. 24-33.</p>

<p><i>Apocalypse of Paul.</i>&mdash;This work (referred to by Augustine,
<i>Tractat. in Joan.</i> 98) contains a description of the things which
the apostle saw in heaven and hell. The text, as first published
in the original Greek by Tischendorf (<i>Apocalypses Apocr.</i> 34-69),
consists of fifty-one chapters, but is imperfect. Internal evidence
assigns it to the time of Theodosius, <i>i.e.</i> about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 388. Where
the author lived is uncertain. Dr Perkins found a Syriac MS.
of this apocalypse, which he translated into English, and printed
in the <i>Journal of the American Oriental Society</i>, 1864, vol. viii.
This was republished by Tischendorf below the Greek version in
the above work. In 1893 the Latin version from one MS. was
edited by M.R. James, <i>Texts and Studies</i>, ii. 1-42, who shows
that the Latin version is the completest of the three, and that
the Greek in its present form is abbreviated.</p>

<p><i>Apocalypse of John</i> (Tischendorf, <i>Apocalypses Apocr.</i> 70 sqq.)
contains a description of the future state, the general resurrection
and judgment, with an account of the punishment of the wicked,
as well as the bliss of the righteous. It appears to be the work
of a Jewish Christian. The date is late, for the writer speaks of
the &ldquo;venerable and holy images,&rdquo; as well as &ldquo;the glorious and
precious crosses and the sacred things of the churches&rdquo; (xiv.),
which points to the 5th century, when such things were first
introduced into churches. It is a feeble imitation of the canonical
apocalypse.</p>

<p><i>Arabic Apocalypse of Peter</i> contains a narrative of events from
the foundation of the world till the second advent of Christ.
The book is said to have been written by Clement, Peter&rsquo;s
disciple. This Arabic work has not been printed, but a summary
of the contents is given by Nicoll in his catalogue of the Oriental
MSS. belonging to the Bodleian (p. 49, xlviii.). There are
eighty-eight chapters. It is a late production; for Ishmaelites
are spoken of, the Crusades, and the taking of Jerusalem. See
Tischendorf, <i>Apocalypses Apocr.</i> pp. xx.-xxiv.</p>

<p><i>The Apocalypse of the Virgin</i>, containing her descent into hell,
is not published entire, but only several portions of it from Greek
MSS. in different libraries, by Tischendorf in his <i>Apocalypses
Apocryphae</i>, pp. 95 sqq.; James, <i>Texts and Studies</i>, ii. 3. 109-126.</p>

<p><i>Apocalypse of Sedrach.</i>&mdash;This late apocalypse, which M.R.
James assigns to the 10th or 11th century, deals with the subject
of intercession for sinners and Sedrach&rsquo;s unwillingness to die.
See James, <i>Texts and Studies</i>, ii. 3. 127-137.</p>

<p><i>Apocalypse of Daniel.</i>&mdash;See Vassiliev&rsquo;s <i>Anecdota Graeco-Byzantina</i>
(Moscow, 1893), pp. 38-44; <i>Uncanonical Books of the
Old Testament</i> (Venice, 1901), pp. 237 sqq., 387 sqq.</p>

<p><i>The Revelations of Bartholomew.</i>&mdash;Dulaurier published from a
Parisian Sahidic MS., subjoining a French translation, what is
termed a fragment of the apocryphal revelations of St Bartholomew

is not free from obscurity. We shall therefore enter at once on
a short account of the origin of this literature in Judaism, of its
adoption by early Christianity, of the various meanings which
the term &ldquo;apocryphal&rdquo; assumed in the course of its history,
and having so done we shall proceed to classify and deal with the
books that belong to this literature. The word most generally
denotes writings which claimed to be, or were by certain sects
regarded as, sacred scriptures although excluded from the
canonical scriptures.</p>

<p><i>Apocrypha in Judaism.</i>&mdash;Certain circles in Judaism, as the
Essenes in Palestine (Josephus, <i>B.J.</i> ii. 8. 7) and the Therapeutae
(Philo, <i>De Vita Contempl.</i> ii. 475, ed. Mangey) in Egypt possessed
a secret literature. But such literature was not confined to the
members of these communities, but had been current among the
Chasids and their successors the Pharisees.<a name="fa1m" id="fa1m" href="#ft1m"><span class="sp">1</span></a> To this literature
belong essentially the apocalypses which were published in fast
succession from Daniel onwards. These works bore, perforce, the
names of ancient Hebrew worthies in order to procure them a
hearing among the writers&rsquo; real contemporaries. To reconcile
their late appearance with their claims to primitive antiquity
the alleged author is represented as &ldquo;shutting up and sealing&rdquo;
(Dan. xii. 4, 9) the book, until the time of its fulfilment had
arrived; for that it was not designed for his own generation
but for far-distant ages (1 Enochi. 2, cviii. 1.; Ass. Mos. i. 16, 17).
It is not improbable that with many Jewish enthusiasts this
literature was more highly treasured than the canonical scriptures.
Indeed, we have a categorical statement to this effect in
4 Ezra xiv. 44 sqq., which tells how Ezra was inspired to dictate
the sacred scriptures which had been destroyed in the overthrow
of Jerusalem: &ldquo;In forty days they wrote ninety-four books:
and it came to pass when the forty days were fulfilled that the
Highest spake, saying: the first that thou hast written publish
openly that the worthy and unworthy may read it; but keep the
seventy last that thou mayst deliver them only to such as be
wise among the people; for in them is the spring of understanding,
the fountain of wisdom and the stream of knowledge.&rdquo;
Such esoteric books are apocryphal in the original conception
of the term. In due course the Jewish authorities were forced
to draw up a canon or book of sacred scriptures, and mark them
off from those which claimed to be such without justification.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page176" id="page176"></a>176</span>
The true scriptures, according to the Jewish canon (Yad. iii. 5;
Toseph. Yad. ii. 3), were those which defiled the hands of such as
touched them. But other scholars, such as Zahn, Schürer, Porter,
state that the secret books with which we have been dealing
formed a class by themselves and were called &ldquo;Genuizim&rdquo;
<span title="gnazim">&#1501;&#1497;&#1494;&#1504;&#1490;</span>, and that this name and idea passed from Judaism
over into the Greek, and that <span class="grk" title="apokrypha biblia">&#7936;&#960;&#972;&#954;&#961;&#965;&#966;&#945; &#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#943;&#945;</span>  is a translation
of <span title="sfarim gnuzim">&#1501;&#1497;&#1494;&#1493;&#1504;&#1490; &#1501;&#1497;&#1512;&#1508;&#1505;</span>. But the Hebrew verb does not mean &ldquo;to
bide&rdquo; but &ldquo;to store away,&rdquo; and is only used of things in themselves
precious. Moreover, the phrase is unknown in Talmudic
literature. The derivation of this idea from Judaism has therefore
not yet been established. Whether the Jews had any distinct
name for these esoteric works we do not know. For writings that
stood wholly without the pale of sacred books such as the books
of heretics or Samaritans they used the designation Hisonim,
Sanh. x. 1 (<span title="sfarim hizonim">&#1501;&#1497;&#1504;&#1493;&#1510;&#1495; &#1501;&#1497;&#1512;&#1508;&#1505;</span> and <span title="sifrei haminim">&#1501;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;&#1502;&#1492; &#1497;&#1512;&#1508;&#1505;</span>). To this class in later
times even Sirach was relegated, and indeed all books not included
in the canon (Midr. r. Num. 14 and on Koheleth xii. 12;
cf. Jer. Sabb. 16).<a name="fa2m" id="fa2m" href="#ft2m"><span class="sp">2</span></a> In Aqiba&rsquo;s time Sirach and other apocryphal
books were not reckoned among the Hisonim; for Sirach was
largely quoted by rabbis in Palestine till the 3rd century <span class="scs">A.D.</span></p>

<p><i>Apocrypha in Christianity.</i>&mdash;Christianity as it springs from its
Founder had no secret or esoteric teaching. It was essentially
the revelation or manifestation of the truth of God. But as
Christianity took its origin from Judaism, it is not unnatural
that a large body of Jewish ideas was incorporated in the system
of Christian thought. The bulk of these in due course underwent
transformation either complete or partial, but there was always
a residuum of incongruous and inconsistent elements existing side
by side with the essential truths of Christianity. This was no
isolated phenomenon; for in every progressive period of the
history of religion we have on the one side the doctrine of God
advancing in depth and fulness: on the other we have cosmological,
eschatological and other survivals, which, however
justifiable in earlier stages, are in unmistakable antagonism with
the theistic beliefs of the time. The eschatology of a nation&mdash;and
the most influential portion of Jewish and Christian apocrypha
are eschatological&mdash;is always the last part of their religion to
experience the transforming power of new ideas and new
facts.</p>

<p>Now the current religious literature of Judaism outside the
canon was composed of apocryphal books, the bulk of which
bore an apocalyptic character, and dealt with the coming of
the Messianic kingdom. These naturally became the popular
religious books of the rising Jewish-Christian communities, and
were held by them in still higher esteem, if possible, than by the
Jews. Occasionally these Jewish writings were re-edited or
adapted to their new readers by Christian additions, but on the
whole it was found sufficient to submit them to a system of
reinterpretation in order to make them testify to the truth of
Christianity and foreshadow its ultimate destinies. Christianity,
moreover, moved by the same apocalyptic tendency as Judaism,
gave birth to new Christian apocryphs, though, in the case of most
of them, the subject matter was to a large extent traditional and
derived from Jewish sources.</p>

<p>Another prolific source of apocryphal gospels, acts and
apocalypses was Gnosticism. While the characteristic features
of apocalyptic literature were derived from Judaism, those of
Gnosticism sprang partly from Greek philosophy, partly from
oriental religions. They insisted on an allegorical interpretation
of the apostolic writings: they alleged themselves to be the
guardians of a secret apostolic tradition and laid claim to prophetic
inspiration. With them, as with the bulk of the Christians
of the 1st and 2nd centuries, apocryphal books as such were
highly esteemed. They were so designated by those who valued
them. It was not till later times that the term became one
of reproach.</p>

<p>We have remarked above that the Jewish apocrypha&mdash;especially
the apocalyptic section and the host of Christian apocryphs&mdash;became
the ordinary religious literature of the early Christians.
And this is not strange seeing that of the former such abundant
use was made by the writers of the New Testament.<a name="fa3m" id="fa3m" href="#ft3m"><span class="sp">3</span></a> Thus Jude
quotes the Book of Enoch by name, while undoubted use of this
book appears in the four gospels and 1 Peter. The influence of
the Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs is still more apparent
in the Pauline Epistles and the Gospels, and the same holds
true of Jubilees and the Assumption of Moses, though in a very
slight degree. The genuineness and inspiration of Enoch were
believed in by the writer of the Ep. of Barnabas, Irenaeus,
Tertullian and Clement of Alexandria. But the high position
which apocryphal books occupied in the first two centuries was
undermined by a variety of influences. All claims to the possession
of a secret tradition were denied (Irenaeus ii. 27. 2, iii. 2. 1,
3. 1; Tertullian, <i>Praescript.</i> 22-27): true inspiration was limited
to the apostolic age, and universal acceptance by the church
was required as a proof of apostolic authorship. Under the
action of such principles apocryphal books tended to pass
into the class of spurious and heretical writings.</p>

<p><i>The Term &ldquo;Apocryphal.&rdquo;</i>&mdash;Turning now to the consideration
of the word &ldquo;apocryphal&rdquo; itself, we find that in its earliest use
it was applied in a laudatory sense to writings,&rsquo;(1) which were
kept secret because they were the vehicles of esoteric knowledge
which was too profound or too sacred to be imparted to any save
the initiated. Thus it occurs in a magical book of Moses, which
has been edited from a Leiden papyrus of the 3rd or 4th century
by Dieterich (Abraxas, 109). This book, which may be as old as
the 1st century, is entitled: &ldquo;A holy and secret Book of Moses,
called eighth, or holy&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="Mouseos iera biblos apokryphos
epikaloumenê ogdoê ê hagia">&#924;&#969;&#965;&#963;&#941;&#969;&#962; &#7985;&#949;&#961;&#8048; &#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#7936;&#960;&#972;&#954;&#961;&#965;&#966;&#959;&#962;
&#7952;&#960;&#953;&#954;&#945;&#955;&#959;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#951; &#8000;&#947;&#948;&#972;&#951; &#8082; &#7937;&#947;&#943;&#945;</span>). The disciples of the Gnostic Prodicus
boasted (Clem. Alex. <i>Strom.</i> i. 15. 69) that they possessed the
secret (<span class="grk" title="aprokryphous">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#973;&#966;&#959;&#965;&#962;</span>) books of Zoroaster. 4 Ezra is in its author&rsquo;s
view a secret work whose value was greater than that of the
canonical scriptures (xiv. 44 sqq.) because of its transcendent
revelations of the future. It is in a like laudatory meaning that
Gregory reckons the New Testament apocalypse as <span class="grk" title="en apokryphois">&#7952;&#957; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#973;&#966;&#959;&#953;&#962;</span>
(<i>Orátio in suam ordinationem</i>, iii. 549, ed. Migne; cf. Epiphanius,
<i>Haer.</i> li. 3). The word enjoyed high consideration among the
Gnostics (cf. Acts of Thomas, 10, 27, 44). (2) But the word was
applied to writings that were kept from public circulation not
because of their transcendent, but of, their secondary or questionable
value. Thus Origen distinguishes between writings which
were read by the churches and apocryphal writings; <span class="grk" title="graphê
mê pheromenê men en tois koinois kai dedêmosieumenois
bibliois eikos d oti en apokryphois pheromenê">&#947;&#961;&#945;&#966;&#8135;
&#956;&#8052; &#966;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#8131; &#956;&#7952;&#957; &#7952;&#957; &#964;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#954;&#959;&#953;&#957;&#959;&#8150;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#949;&#948;&#951;&#956;&#959;&#963;&#953;&#949;&#965;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#959;&#953;&#962;
&#946;&#953;&#946;&#955;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#949;&#7984;&#954;&#8000;&#962; &#948;&#8125; &#8005;&#964;&#953; &#7952;&#957; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#961;&#973;&#966;&#959;&#953;&#962; &#966;&#949;&#961;&#959;&#956;&#941;&#957;&#8131;</span> (Origen&rsquo;s <i>Comm.
in Matt.</i>, x. 18, on Matt. xiii. 57, ed. Lommatzsch iii. 49 sqq.).
Cf. <i>Epist. ad Africam</i>, ix. (Lommatzsch xvii. 31): Euseb. <i>H.E.</i> ii.
23, 25; iii. 3, 6. See Zahn, <i>Gesch. Kanons</i>, i. 126 sqq. Thus the
meaning of <span class="grk" title="apokryphros">&#7936;&#960;&#972;&#954;&#961;&#965;&#966;&#959;&#962;</span> is here practically equivalent to &ldquo;excluded
from the public use of the church,&rdquo; and prepares the way for the
third and unfavourable sense of this word. (3) The word came
finally to mean what is false, spurious, bad, heretical. If we
may trust the text, this meaning appears in Origen (<i>Prolog, in
Cant. Cantic.</i>, Lommatzsch xiv. 325): &ldquo;De scripturis his, quae
appellantur apocryphae, pro eo quod multa in iis corrupta et
contra fidem veram inveniuntur a majoribus tradita non placuit
iis dari locum nec admitti ad auctoritatem.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In addition to the above three meanings strange uses of the
term appear in the western church. Thus the Gelasian Decree
includes the works of Eusebius, Tertullian and Clement of
Alexandria, under this designation. Augustine (<i>De Civ. Dei</i>,
xv. 23) explains it as meaning obscurity of origin, while Jerome
(<i>Protogus Galeatus</i>) declares that all books outside the Hebrew
canon belong to this class of apocrypha. Jerome&rsquo;s practice,
however, did not square with his theory. The western church
did not accept Jerome&rsquo;s definition of apocrypha, but retained the
word in its original meaning, though great confusion prevailed.
Thus the degree of estimation in which the apocryphal books
have been held in the church has varied much according to place
and time. As they stood in the Septuagint or Greek canon, along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page177" id="page177"></a>177</span>
with the other books, and with no marks of distinction, they were
practically employed by the Greek Fathers in the same way as
the other books; hence Origen, Clement and others often cite
them as &ldquo;scripture,&rdquo; &ldquo;divine scripture,&rdquo; &ldquo;inspired,&rdquo; and the
like. On the other hand, teachers connected with Palestine, and
familiar with the Hebrew canon, rigidly exclude all but the books
contained there. This view is reflected, for example, in the
canon of Melito of Sardis, and in the prefaces and letters of
Jerome. Augustine, however (<i>De Doct. Christ</i>. ii. 8), attaches
himself to the other side. Two well-defined views in this way
prevailed, to which was added a third, according to which the
books, though not to be put in the same rank as the canonical
scriptures of the Hebrew collection, yet were of value for moral
uses and to be read in congregations,&mdash;and hence they were
called &ldquo;ecclesiastical&rdquo;&mdash;a designation first found in Rufinus
(<i>ob</i>. 410). Notwithstanding the decisions of some councils held
in Africa, which were in favour of the view of Augustine, these
diverse opinions regarding the apocryphal books continued to
prevail in the church down through the ages till the great dogmatic
era of the Reformation. At that epoch the same three
opinions were taken up and congealed into dogmas, which may
be considered characteristic of the churches adopting them. In
1546 the council of Trent adopted the canon of Augustine,
declaring &ldquo;He is also to be anathema who does not receive these
entire books, with all their parts, as they have been accustomed
to be read in the Catholic Church, and are found in the ancient
editions of the Latin Vulgate, as sacred and canonical.&rdquo; The
whole of the books in question, with the exception of 1st and
2nd Esdras, and the Prayer of Manasses, were declared canonical
at Trent. On the other hand, the Protestants universally
adhered to the opinion that only the books in the Hebrew
collection are canonical. Already Wycliffe had declared that
&ldquo;whatever book is in the Old Testament besides these twenty-five
(Hebrew) shall be set among the apocrypha, that is, without
authority or belief.&rdquo; Yet among the churches of the Reformation
a milder and a severer view prevailed regarding the apocrypha.
Both in the German and English translations (Luther&rsquo;s,
1537; Coverdale&rsquo;s, 1535, &amp;c.) these books are separated from
the others and set by themselves; but while in some confessions,
<i>e.g.</i> the Westminster, a decided judgment is passed on them,
that they are not &ldquo;to be any otherwise approved or made use
of than other human writings,&rdquo; a milder verdict is expressed
regarding them in many other quarters, <i>e.g.</i> in the &ldquo;argument&rdquo;
prefixed to them in the Geneva Bible; in the Sixth Article of the
Church of England, where it is said that &ldquo;the other books the
church doth read for example of life and instruction of manners,&rdquo;
though not to establish doctrine; and elsewhere.</p>

<p class="pt2 center sc">Old Testament Apocryphal Books</p>

<p>We shall now proceed to enumerate the apocryphal books:
first the Apocrypha Proper, and next the rest of the Old and
New Testament apocryphal literature.</p>

<p>1. <i>The Apocrypha Proper</i>, or the apocrypha of the Old
Testament as used by English-speaking Protestants, consists of
the following books: 1 Esdras, 2 Esdras, Tobit, Judith, Additions
to Esther, Wisdom of Solomon, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, Epistle
of Jeremy, Additions to Daniel (Song of the Three Holy Children,
History of Susannah, and Bel and the Dragon), Prayer of
Manasses, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees. Thus the Apocrypha
Proper constitutes the surplusage of the Vulgate or Bible of the
Roman Church over the Hebrew Old Testament. Since this
surplusage is in turn derived from the Septuagint, from which
the old Latin version was translated, it thus follows that the
difference between the Protestant and the Roman Catholic Old
Testament is, roughly speaking, traceable to the difference
between the Palestinian and the Alexandrian canons of the Old
Testament. But this is only true with certain reservations;
for the Latin Vulgate was revised by Jerome according to the
Hebrew, and, where Hebrew originals were wanting, according to
the Septuagint. Furthermore, the Vulgate rejects 3 and 4
Maccabees and Psalm cli., which generally appear in the Septuagint,
while the Septuagint and Luther&rsquo;s Bible reject 4 Ezra,
which is found in the Vulgate and the Apocrypha Proper.
Luther&rsquo;s Bible, moreover, rejects also 3 Ezra. It should further
be observed that the Vulgate adds the Prayer of Manasses and
3 and 4 Ezra after the New Testament as apocryphal.</p>

<p>It is hardly possible to form any classification which is not
open to some objection. In any case the classification must be
to some extent provisional, since scholars are still divided as to
the original language, date and place of composition of some of
the books which must come under our classification.<a name="fa4m" id="fa4m" href="#ft4m"><span class="sp">4</span></a> We may,
however, discriminate (i.) the Palestinian and (ii.) the Hellenistic
literature of the Old Testament, though even this distinction is
open to serious objections. The former literature was generally
written in Hebrew or Aramaic, and seldom in Greek; the latter
naturally in Greek. Next, within these literatures we shall
distinguish three or four classes according to the nature of the
subject with which they deal. Thus the books of which we
have to treat will be classed as: (<i>a</i>) Historical, (<i>b</i>) Legendary
(Haggadic), (<i>c</i>) Apocalyptic, (<i>d</i>) Didactic or Sapiential.</p>

Chronicles. As the chronicler rewrote the history of Israel and
Judah from the basis of the Priests&rsquo; Code, so our author re-edited
from the Pharisaic standpoint of his time the book of Genesis and
the early chapters of Exodus. His work constitutes an enlarged
targum on these books, and its object is to prove the everlasting
validity of the law, which, though revealed in time, was superior
to time. Writing in the palmiest days of the Maccabean
dominion, he looked for the immediate advent of the Messianic
kingdom. This kingdom was to be ruled over by a Messiah
sprung not from Judah but from Levi, that is, from the reigning
Maccabean family. This kingdom was to be gradually realized
on earth, the transformation of physical nature going hand in
hand with the ethical transformation of man. (For a fuller
account see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Jubilees, Book of</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Paralipomena Jeremiae</i>, or the <i>Rest of the Words of Baruch.</i>&mdash;
This book has been preserved in Greek, Ethiopic, Armenian and
Slavonic. The Greek was first printed at Venice in 1609, and
next by Ceriani in 1868 under the title <i>Paralipomena Jeremiae</i>.
It bears the same name in the Armenian, but in Ethiopic it is
known by the second title. (See under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Baruch</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Martyrdom of Isaiah.</i>&mdash;This Jewish work has been in part
preserved in the <i>Ascension of Isaiah</i>. To it belong i. 1, 2<span class="sp">a</span>, 6<span class="sp">b</span>-13<span class="sp">a</span>;
ii. 1-8, 10-iii. 12; v. 1<span class="sp">c</span>-14 of that book. It is of Jewish origin,
and recounts the martyrdom of Isaiah at the hands of Manasseh.
(See <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Isaiah, Ascension of</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Pseudo-Philo&rsquo;s Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum.</i>&mdash;Though the
Latin version of this book was thrice printed in the 16th century
(in 1527, 1550 and 1599), it was practically unknown to modern
scholars till it was recognized by Conybeare and discussed by
Cohn in the <i>Jewish Quarterly Review</i>, 1898, pp. 279-332. It is
an Haggadic revision of the Biblical history from Adam to the
death of Saul. Its chronology agrees frequently with the LXX.
against that of the Massoretic text, though conversely in a few
cases. The Latin is undoubtedly translated from the Greek.
Greek words are frequently transliterated. While the LXX. is
occasionally followed in its translation of Biblical passages, in
others the Massoretic is followed against the LXX., and in one
or two passages the text presupposes a text different from both.
On many grounds Cohn infers a Hebrew original. The eschatology
is similar to that taught in the similitudes of the Book of
Enoch. In fact, Eth. En. li. 1 is reproduced in this connexion.
Prayers of the departed are said to be valueless. The book was
written after <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 70; for, as Cohn has shown, the exact date of
the fall of Herod&rsquo;s temple is predicted.</p>

<p><i>Life of Adam and Eve.</i>&mdash;Writings dealing with this subject
are extant in Greek, Latin, Slavonic, Syriac, Armenian and
Arabic. They go back undoubtedly to a Jewish basis, but in
some of the forms in which they appear at present they are
christianized throughout. The oldest and for the most part
Jewish portion of this literature is preserved to us in Greek,
Armenian, Latin and Slavonic, (i.) The Greek <span class="grk" title="Diêgêsis peri
Adam kai Euas">&#916;&#953;&#942;&#947;&#951;&#963;&#953;&#962; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054;
&#902;&#948;&#8048;&#956; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#917;&#8020;&#945;&#962;</span>  (published under the misleading title <span class="grk" title="Apokalypsis
Mouseos">&#902;&#960;&#959;&#954;&#940;&#955;&#965;&#968;&#953;&#962; &#924;&#969;&#965;&#963;&#941;&#969;&#962;</span> in Tischendorf&rsquo;s <i>Apocalypses Apocryphae</i>, 1866) deals
with the Fall and the death of Adam and Eve. Ceriani edited this
text from a Milan MS. (<i>Monumenta Sacra et Profana</i>, v. i).
This work is found also in Armenian, and has been published
by the Mechitharist community in Venice in their <i>Collection of
Uncanonical Writings of the Old Testament</i>, and translated by
Conybeare (<i>Jewish Quarterly Review</i>, vii. 216 sqq., 1895), and by
Issaverdens in 1901. (ii.) The <i>Vita Adae et Evae</i> is closely related
and in part identical with (i.). It was printed by W. Meyer in
<i>Abh. d. Münch. Akad.</i>, Philos.-philol. Cl. xiv., 1878. (iii.) The
Slavonic Adam book was published by Jaji&#263; along with a Latin
translation (<i>Denkschr. d. Wien. Akad. d. Wiss.</i> xlii., 1893).
This version agrees for the most part with (i.). It has, moreover,
a section, §§ 28-39, which though not found in (i.) is found in (ii.).
Before we discuss these three documents we shall mention other
members of this literature, which, though derivable ultimately
from Jewish sources, are Christian in their present form, (iv.)
<i>The Book of Adam and Eve</i>, also called the <i>Conflict of Adam and
Eve with Satan</i>, translated from the Ethiopic (1882) by Malan.
This was first translated by Dillmann (<i>Das christl. Adambuch
des Morgenlandes</i>, 1853), and the Ethiopic book first edited by
Trump (<i>Abh. d. Münch. Akad.</i> xv., 1870-1881). (v.) A Syriac
work entitled <i>Die Schalzhöhle</i> translated by Bezold from three
Syriac MSS. in 1883 and subsequently edited in Syriac in 1888.
This work has close affinities to (iv.), but is said by Dillmann to
be more original, (vi.) Armenian books on the <i>Death of Adam</i>
(<i>Uncanonical Writings of O.T.</i> pp. 84 sqq., 1901, translated from
the Armenian), <i>Creation and Transgression of Adam</i> (<i>op. cit.</i>
39 sqq.), <i>Expulsion of Adam from Paradise</i> (<i>op. cit.</i> 47 sqq.),
<i>Penitence of Adam and Eve</i> (<i>op. cit.</i> 71 sqq.) are mainly later
writings from Christian hands.</p>

<p>Returning to the question of the Jewish origin of i., ii., iii., we
have already observed that these spring from a common original.
As to the language of this original, scholars are divided. The
evidence, however, seems to be strongly in favour of Hebrew.
How otherwise are we to explain such Hebraisms (or Syriacisms)
as <span class="grk" title="euo rheei to helaion ex autou">&#7952;&#957;&#8102; &#8165;&#941;&#949;&#953; &#964;&#8056; &#7956;&#955;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#7952;&#958; &#945;&#8016;&#964;&#959;&#8166;</span>
(§ 9), <span class="grk" title="ou eipen ... mê phagein ap

has pointed out, in the words <span class="grk" title="hesau en mataiois">&#7956;&#963;&#8131; &#7952;&#957; &#956;&#945;&#964;&#945;&#943;&#959;&#953;&#962;</span> addressed to
Eve (§ 25) there is a corruption of <span title="havalim">&#1501;&#1497;&#1500;&#1489;&#1495;</span> into <span title="avalim">&#1501;&#1497;&#1500;&#1489;&#1492;</span>. Thus
the words were: &ldquo;Thou shalt have pangs.&rdquo; In fact, Hebraisms
abound throughout this book. (See Fuchs, <i>Apok. u. Pseud,
d. A.T.</i> ii. 511; <i>Jewish Encyc.</i> i. 179 sq.)</p>

<p><i>Jannes and Jambres.</i>&mdash;These two men are referred to in
2 Tim. iii. 8 as the Egyptian magicians who withstood Moses.
The book which treats of them is mentioned by Origen (<i>ad
Matt.</i> xxiii. 37 and xxvii. 9 [<i>Jannes et Mambres Liber</i>]), and in
the Gelasian Decree as the Paenitentia Jamnis et Mambre. The
names in Greek are generally <span class="grk" title="Iannês kai Iambrês">&#906;&#945;&#957;&#957;&#8134;&#962; &#954;&#945;&#8054; &#906;&#945;&#956;&#946;&#961;&#8134;&#962;</span> (= <span title="yanim veyambarim">&#1501;&#1497;&#1512;&#1489;&#1502;&#1497;&#1493; &#1501;&#1497;&#1504;&#1497;</span>)
as in the Targ.-Jon. on Exod. i. 15; vii. ii. In the Talmud
they appear as <span title="iohani umamra">&#1488;&#1512;&#1502;&#1502;&#1493; &#1497;&#1504;&#1495;&#1493;&#1497;</span>. Since the western text of 2 Tim. iii. 8
has <span class="grk" title="Mambrês">&#924;&#945;&#956;&#946;&#961;&#8134;&#962;</span>, Westcott and Hort infer that this form was derived
from a Palestinian source. These names were known not only
to Jewish but also to heathen writers, such as Pliny and Apuleius.
The book, therefore, may go back to pre-Christian times. (See
Schürer<span class="sp">3</span> iii. 292-294; <i>Ency. Biblica</i>, ii. 2327-2329.)</p>

<p><i>Joseph and Asenath.</i>&mdash;The statement in Gen. xli. 45, 50 that
Joseph married the daughter of a heathen priest naturally gave
offence to later Judaism, and gave rise to the fiction that Asenath
was really the daughter of Shechem and Dinah, and only the
foster-daughter of Potipherah (<i>Targ.-Jon.</i> on Gen. xli. 45;
Tractat. <i>Sopherim</i>, xxi. 9; <i>Jalkut Shimoni</i>, c. 134. See Oppenheim,
<i>Fabula Josephi et Asenethae</i>, 1886, pp. 2-4). Origen also
was acquainted with some form of the legend (<i>Selecta in Genesin</i>,
ad Gen. xli. 45, ed. Lommatzsch, viii. 89-90). The Christian
legend, which is no doubt in the main based on the Jewish, is
found in Greek, Syriac, Armenian, Slavonic and Medieval Latin.
Since it is not earlier than the 3rd or 4th century, it will be
sufficient here to refer to Smith&rsquo;s <i>Dict. of Christ. Biog.</i> i. 176-177;
Hastings&rsquo; <i>Bible Dict.</i> i. 162-163; Schürer, iii. 289-291.</p>

<p>(<i>d</i>) <i>Didactic or Sapiential.</i>&mdash;The <i>Pirke Aboth</i>, a collection of
sayings of the Jewish Fathers, are preserved in the 9th Tractate
of the Fourth Order of the Mishnah. They are attributed to
some sixty Jewish teachers, belonging for the most part to the
years <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 70-170, though a few of them are of a much earlier
date. The book holds the same place in rabbinical literature as
the Book of Proverbs in the Bible. The sayings are often
admirable. Thus in iv. 1-4, &ldquo;Who is wise? He that learns
from every man.... Who is mighty? He that subdues his
nature.... Who is rich? He that is contented with his lot....
Who is honoured? He that honours mankind.&rdquo; (See

<p>(<i>a</i>) <span class="sc">Gospels</span>.&mdash;<i>Uncanonical Sayings of the Lord in Christian
and Jewish Sources.</i>&mdash;Under the head of canonical sayings not
found in the Gospels only one is found, <i>i.e.</i> that in Acts xx. 35.
Of the rest the uncanonical sayings have been collected by
Preuschen (<i>Reste der ausserkanonischen Evangelien</i>, 1901, pp.
44-47). A different collection will be found in Hennecke,
<i>NTliche Apok.</i> 9-11. The same subject is dealt with in the
elaborate volumes of Resch (<i>Aussercanonische Paralleltexte zu
den Evangelien</i>, vols. i.-iii., 1893-1895).</p>

<p>To this section belongs also the <i>Fayum Gospel Fragment</i> and the
<i>Logia</i> published by Grenfell and Hunt.<a name="fa5m" id="fa5m" href="#ft5m"><span class="sp">5</span></a> The former contains
two sayings of Christ and one of Peter, such as we find in the
canonical gospels, Matt. xxvi. 31-34, Mark xiv. 27-30. The papyrus,
which is of the 3rd century, was discovered by Bickell among
the Rainer collection, who characterized it (<i>Z. f. kath. Theol.</i>,
1885, pp. 498-504) as a fragment of one of the primitive gospels
mentioned in Luke i. 1. On the other hand, it has been contended
that it is merely a fragment of an early patristic homily. (See
Zahn, <i>Gesch. Kanons</i>, ii. 780-790; Harnack, <i>Texte und Untersuchungen</i>,
v. 4; Preuschen, op. cit. p. 19.) The <i>Logia</i> (<i>q.v.</i>) is
the name given to the sayings contained in a papyrus leaf, by
its discoverers Grenfell and Hunt. They think the papyrus
was probably written about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 200. According to Harnack,
it is an extract from the <i>Gospel of the Egyptians</i>. All the passages
referring to Jesus in the Talmud are given by Laible, <i>Jesus
Christus im Talmud</i>, with an appendix, &ldquo;Die talmudischen
Texte,&rdquo; by G. Dalman (2nd ed. 1901). The first edition of this
work was translated into English by A.W. Streane (<i>Jesus Christ
in the Talmud</i>, 1893). In Hennecke&rsquo;s <i>NTliche Apok. Handbuch</i>
(pp. 47-71) there is a valuable study of this question by A. Meyer,
entitled <i>Jesus, Jesu Jünger und das Evangelium im Talmud und
verwandten jüdischen Schriflen</i>, to which also a good bibliography
of the subject is prefixed.</p>

<p><i>Gospel according to the Egyptians.</i>&mdash;This gospel is first mentioned
by Clem. Alex. (<i>Strom.</i> iii. 6. 45; 9. 63, 66; 13. 92),
subsequently by Origen (<i>Hom. in Luc.</i> i.) and Epiphanius
(<i>Haer.</i> lxii. 2), and a fragment is preserved in the so-called
2 Clem. Rom. xii. 2. It circulated among various heretical
circles; amongst the Encratites (Clem. <i>Strom.</i> iii. 9), the Naas-senes
(Hippolyt. <i>Philos.</i> v. 7), and the Sabellians (Epiph. <i>Haer.</i>
lxii. 2). Only three or four fragments survive; see Lipsius
(Smith and Wace, <i>Dict. of Christ. Biog.</i> ii. 712, 713); Zahn,
<i>Gesch. Kanons</i>, ii. 628-642; Preuschen, <i>Reste d. ausserkanonischen Evangelien</i>, 1901, p. 2, which show that it was a product
of pantheistic Gnosticism. With this pantheistic Gnosticism
is associated a severe asceticism. The distinctions of sex are
one day to come to an end; the prohibition of marriage follows
naturally on this view. Hence Christ is represented as coming
to destroy the work of the female (Clem. Alex. <i>Strom.</i> iii. 9. 63).
Lipsius and Zahn assign it to the middle of the 2nd century.
It may be earlier.</p>

<p><i>Protevangel of James.</i>&mdash;This title was first given in the 16th
century to a writing which is referred to as <i>The Book of James</i>
(<span class="grk" title="hê biblos Iakobou">&#7969; &#946;&#943;&#946;&#955;&#959;&#962; &#906;&#945;&#954;&#974;&#946;&#959;&#965;</span>) by Origen (tom. xi. <i>in Matt.</i>). Its author
designates it as <span class="grk" title="Istoria">&#906;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#961;&#943;&#945;</span>. For various other designations see
Tischendorf, <i>Evang. Apocr.</i><span class="sp">2</span> 1 seq. The narrative extends from
the Conception of the Virgin to the Death of Zacharias. Lipsius
shows that in the present form of the book there is side by side
a strange &ldquo;admixture of intimate knowledge and gross ignorance
of Jewish thought and custom,&rdquo; and that accordingly we must
&ldquo;distinguish between an original Jewish Christian writing and a
Gnostic recast of it.&rdquo; The former was known to Justin (<i>Dial.</i>
78, 101) and Clem. Alex. (<i>Strom.</i> vii. 16), and belongs at latest
to the earliest years of the 2nd century. The Gnostic recast
Lipsius dates about the middle of the 3rd century. From these
two works arose independently the <i>Protevangel</i> in its present
form and the Latin pseudo-Matthaeus (<i>Evangelium pseudo-Matthaei</i>).
The <i>Evangelium de Nativitate Mariae</i> is a redaction
of the latter. (See Lipsius in Smith&rsquo;s <i>Dict. of Christ. Biog.</i>
ii. 701-703.) But if we except the Zachariah and John group
of legends, it is not necessary to assume the Gnostic recast of
this work in the 3rd century as is done by Lipsius. The author
had at his disposal two distinct groups of legends about Mary.
One of these groups is certainly of non-Jewish origin, as it
conceives Mary as living in the temple somewhat after the
manner of a vestal virgin or a priestess of Isis. The other group
is more in accord with the orthodox gospels. The book appears
to have been written in Egypt, and in the early years of the
2nd century. For, since Origen states that many appealed to it
in support of the view that the brothers of Jesus were sons of
Joseph by a former marriage, the book must have been current
about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 200. From Origen we may ascend to Clem. Alex.
who (<i>Strom.</i> vi. 93) shows acquaintance with one of the chief
doctrines of the book&mdash;the perpetual virginity of Mary. Finally,
as Justin&rsquo;s statements as to the birth of Jesus in a cave and
Mary&rsquo;s descent from David show in all probability his acquaintance
with the book, it may with good grounds be assigned to
the first decade of the 2nd century. (So Zahn, <i>Gesch. Kanons</i>,
i. 485, 499, 502, 504, 539; ii. 774-780.) For the Greek text see
Tischendorf, <i>Evang. Apocr.</i><span class="sp">2</span> 1-50; B.P. Grenfell, <i>An Alexandrian
erotic Fragment and other Papyri</i>, 1896, pp. 13-17:

<p><i>Gospel of Nicodemus.</i>&mdash;This title is first met with in the 13th
century. It is used to designate an apocryphal writing entitled
in the older MSS. <span class="grk" title="hypomnêmata tou Kuriou hêmon Iêsou Christou
praxchenta epi Pontiou Pilatou">&#8017;&#960;&#959;&#956;&#957;&#942;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#945; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#922;&#965;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#965; &#7969;&#956;&#8182;&#957; &#906;&#951;&#963;&#959;&#8166; &#935;&#961;&#953;&#963;&#964;&#959;&#8166;

Domini ... inventa Theodosio magno imperatore in Ierusalem
in praetorio Pontii Pilati in codicibus publicis.&rdquo; See Tischendorf,
<i>Evang. Apocr.</i><span class="sp">2</span> pp. 333-335. This work gives an account
of the Passion (i.-xi.), the Resurrection (xii.-xvi.), and the
<i>Descensus ad Inferos</i> (xvii.-xxvii.). Chapters i.-xvi. are extant,
in the Greek, Coptic, and two Armenian versions. The two Latin
versions and a Byzantine recension of the Greek contain i.-xxvii.
(see Tischendorf, <i>Evangelia Apocrypha</i><span class="sp">2</span>, pp. 210-458). All
known texts go back to <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 425, if one may trust the reference
to Theodosius. But this was only a revision, for as early as
376 Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i> i. 1.) presupposes the existence of a like
text. In 325 Eusebius (<i>H.E.</i> ii. 2) was acquainted only with
the heathen <i>Acts of Pilate</i>, and knew nothing of a Christian work.
Tischendorf and Hofmann, however, find evidence of its existence
in Justin&rsquo;s reference to the <span class="grk" title="Hakta Pilatou">&#8142;&#913;&#954;&#964;&#945; &#928;&#953;&#955;&#940;&#964;&#959;&#965;</span> (<i>Apol.</i> i. 35, 48), and in
Tertullian&rsquo;s mention of the <i>Acta Pilati</i> (<i>Apol.</i> 21), and on this
evidence attribute our texts to the first half of the 2nd century.
But these references have been denied by Scholten, Lipsius, and
Lightfoot. Recently Schubert has sought to derive the elements
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>180</span>
which are found in the Petrine Gospel, but not in the canonical
gospels, from the original <i>Acta Pilati</i>, while Zahn exactly reverses
the relation of these two works. Rendel Harris (1899) advocated
the view that the Gospel of Nicodemus, as we possess it, is merely
a prose version of the Gospel of Nicodemus written originally in
Homeric centones as early as the 2nd century. Lipsius and
Dobschütz relegate the book to the 4th century. The question is
not settled yet (see Lipsius in Smith&rsquo;s <i>Dict. of Christ. Biography</i>,
ii. 708-709, and Dobschütz in Hastings&rsquo; <i>Bible Dictionary</i>, iii.
544-547).</p>

<p><i>Gospel according to the Hebrews.</i>&mdash;This gospel was cited by
Ignatius (<i>Ad Smyrnaeos</i>, iii.) according to Jerome (<i>Viris illus.</i>
16, and <i>in Jes.</i> lib. xviii.), but this is declared to be untrustworthy
by Zahn, op. cit. i. 921; ii. 701, 702. It was written in Aramaic
in Hebrew letters, according to Jerome (<i>Adv. Pelag.</i> iii. 2), and
translated by him into Greek and Latin. Both these translations
are lost. A collection of the Greek and Latin fragments that
have survived, mainly in Origen and Jerome, will be found in
Hilgenfeld&rsquo;s <i>NT extra Canonem receptum</i>, Nicholson&rsquo;s <i>Gospel
according to the Hebrews</i> (1879), Westcott&rsquo;s <i>Introd. to the Gospels</i>,
and Zahn&rsquo;s <i>Gesch. des NTlichen Kanons</i>, ii. 642-723; Preuschen,
op. cit. 3-8. This gospel was regarded by many in the first
centuries as the Hebrew original of the canonical Matthew
(Jerome, <i>in Matt.</i> xii. 13; <i>Adv. Pelag.</i> iii. 1). With the canonical
gospel it agrees in some of its sayings; in others it is independent.
It circulated among the Nazarenes in Syria, and was composed,
according to Zahn (<i>op. cit.</i> ii. 722), between the years 135 and 150.
Jerome identifies it with the <i>Gospel of the Twelve</i> (<i>Adv. Pelag.</i>
iii. 2), and states that it was used by the Ebionites (<i>Comm. in
Matt.</i> xii. 13). Zahn (<i>op. cit.</i> ii. 662, 724) contests both these
statements. The former he traces to a mistaken interpretation
of Origen (<i>Hom. I. in Luc.</i>). Lipsius, on the other hand, accepts
the statements of Jerome (Smith and Wace, <i>Dict. of Christian
Biography</i>, ii. 709-712), and is of opinion that this gospel, in the
form in which it was known to Epiphanius, Jerome and Origen,
was &ldquo;a recast of an older original,&rdquo; which, written originally in
Aramaic, was nearly related to the Logia used by St Matthew
and the Ebionitic writing used by St Luke, &ldquo;which itself was
only a later redaction of the Logia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>According to the most recent investigations we may conclude
that the Gospel according to the Hebrews was current among
the Nazarenes and Ebionites as early as 100-125, since Ignatius
was familiar with the phrase &ldquo;I am no bodiless demon&rdquo;&mdash;a
phrase which, according to Jerome (<i>Comm. in Is.</i> xviii.), belonged
to this Gospel.</p>

<p>The name &ldquo;Gospel according to the Hebrews&rdquo; cannot have
been original; for if it had been so named because of its general
use among the Hebrews, yet the Hebrews themselves would not
have used this designation. It may have been known simply as
&ldquo;the Gospel.&rdquo; The language was Western Aramaic, the mother
tongue of Jesus and his apostles. Two forms of Western
Aramaic survive: the Jerusalem form of the dialect, in the
Aramaic portions of Daniel and Ezra; and the Galilean, in
isolated expressions in the Talmud (3rd century), and in a fragmentary
5th century translation of the Bible. The quotations
from the Old Testament are made from the Massoretic text.</p>

<p>This gospel must have been translated at an early date into
Greek, as Clement and Origen cite it as generally accessible,
and Eusebius recounts that many reckoned it among the received
books The gospel is synoptic in character and is closely related
to Matthew, though in the Resurrection accounts it has affinities
with Luke. Like Mark it seems to have had no history of the
birth of Christ, and to have begun with the baptism. (For the
literature see Hennecke, <i>NTliche Apok. Handbuch</i>, 21-23.)</p>

<p><i>Gospel of Peter.</i>&mdash;Before 1892 we had some knowlege of this
gospel. Thus Serapion, bishop of Antioch (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 190-203) found
it in use in the church of Rhossus in Cilicia, and condemned it as
Docetic (Eusebius, <i>H.E.</i> vi. 12). Again, Origen (<i>In Matt.</i> tom.
xvii. 10) says that it represented the brethren of Christ as his
half-brothers In 1885 a long fragment was discovered at
Akhmim, and published by Bouriant in 1892, and subsequently
by Lods, Robinson, Harnack, Zahn, Schubert, Swete.</p>

<p><i>Gospel of Thomas.</i>&mdash;This gospel professes to give an account of
our Lord&rsquo;s boyhood. It appears in two recensions. The more
complete recension bears the title <span class="grk" title="Thoma Isrêalitou Philosophou
hrêta eis ta paidika Kuriou">&#920;&#969;&#956;&#8118; &#906;&#963;&#961;&#945;&#951;&#955;&#943;&#964;&#959;&#965; &#934;&#953;&#955;&#959;&#963;&#972;&#966;&#959;&#965;

the 7th to the 12th year (Tischendorf, <i>Evangelia Apocrypha</i><span class="sp">2</span>,
1876, 140-157). The more fragmentary recension gives the
history of the childhood from the 5th to the 8th year, and is
entitled <span class="grk" title="Sungramma tou hagiou apostolou Thoma peri tês paidikês
anastrophês tou Kuriou">&#931;&#973;&#947;&#947;&#961;&#945;&#956;&#956;&#945; &#964;&#959;&#8166; &#7937;&#947;&#943;&#959;&#965; &#7936;&#960;&#959;&#963;&#964;&#972;&#955;&#959;&#965; &#920;&#969;&#956;&#8118; &#960;&#949;&#961;&#8054; &#964;&#8134;&#962; &#960;&#945;&#953;&#948;&#953;&#954;&#8134;&#962;

Two Latin translations have been published in this work by the
same scholar&mdash;one on pp. 164-180, the other under the wrong
title, <i>Pseudo-Matthaei Evangelium</i>, on pp. 93-112. A Syriac
version, with an English translation, was published by Wright
in 1875. This gospel was originally still more Docetic than it
now is, according to Lipsius. Its present form is due to an orthodox
revision which discarded, so far as possible, all Gnostic
traces. Lipsius (Smith&rsquo;s <i>Dict. of Christ. Biog.</i> ii. 703) assigns it
to the latter half of the 2nd century, but Zahn (<i>Gesch. Kan.</i> ii.
771), on good grounds, to the earlier half. The latter scholar
shows that probably it was used by Justin (<i>Dial.</i> 88). At all
events it circulated among the Marcosians (Irenaeus, <i>Haer.</i> i. 20)
and the Naasenes (Hippolytus, <i>Refut.</i> v. 7), and subsequently
among the Manichaeans, and is frequently quoted from Origen
downwards (<i>Hom. I. in Luc.</i>). If the stichometry of Nicephorus
is right, the existing form of the book is merely fragmentary
compared with its original compass. For literature see Hennecke,
<i>NTliche Apokryphen Handbuch</i>, 132 seq.</p>

<p><i>Gospel of the Twelve.</i>&mdash;This gospel, which Origen knew (<i>Hom.
I. in Luc.</i>), is not to be identified with the <i>Gospel according to the
Hebrews</i> (see above), with Lipsius and others, who have sought
to reconstruct the original gospel from the surviving fragments
of these two distinct works. The only surviving fragments of
the <i>Gospel of the Twelve</i> have been preserved by Epiphanius
(<i>Haer.</i> xxx. 13-16, 22: see Preuschen, <i>op. cit.</i> 9-11). It began
with an account of the baptism. It was used by the Ebionites,
and was written, according to Zahn (<i>op. cit.</i> ii. 742), about
<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 170.</p>

<p><span class="sc">Other Gospels Mainly Gnostic and almost all Lost</span>.&mdash;
<i>Gospel of Andrew.</i>&mdash;This is condemned in the Gelasian Decree,
and is probably the gospel mentioned by Innocent (1 Ep. iii. 7)
and Augustine (<i>Contra advers. Leg. et Proph.</i> i. 20).</p>

<p><i>Gospel of Apelles.</i>&mdash;Mentioned by Jerome in his <i>Prooem. ad
Matt.</i></p>

<p><i>Gospel of Barnabas.</i>&mdash;Condemned in the Gelasian Decree (see
under <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Barnabas</a></span> <i>ad fin</i>.).</p>

<p><i>Gospel of Bartholomew.</i>&mdash;Mentioned by Jerome in his <i>Prooem.
ad Matt.</i> and condemned in the Gelasian Decree.</p>

<p><i>Gospel of Basilides.</i>&mdash;Mentioned by Origen (<i>Tract. 26 in Matt.</i>
xxxiii. 34, and in his <i>Prooem. in Luc.</i>); by Jerome in his <i>Prooem.
in Matt.</i> (See Harnack i. 161; ii. 536-537; Zahn, <i>Gesch.
Kanons</i>, i. 763-774.)</p>

<p><i>Gospel of Cerinthus.</i>&mdash;Mentioned by Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i> li. 7).</p>

<p><i>Gospel of the Ebionites.</i>&mdash;A fragmentary edition of the canonical
Matthew according to Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i> xxx. 13), used by the
Ebionites and called by them the Hebrew Gospel.</p>

<p><i>Gospel of Eve.</i>&mdash;A quotation from this gospel is given by
Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i> xxvi. 2, 3). It is possible that this is the
Gospel of Perfection (<span class="grk" title="Euangelion teleioseos">&#917;&#8016;&#945;&#947;&#947;&#941;&#955;&#953;&#959;&#957; &#964;&#949;&#955;&#949;&#953;&#974;&#963;&#949;&#969;&#962;</span>) which he touches
upon in xxvi. 2. The quotation shows that this gospel was the
expression of complete pantheism.</p>

<p><i>Gospel of James the Less.</i>&mdash;Condemned in the Gelasian Decree.</p>

<p><i>Wisdom of Jesus Christ.</i>&mdash;This third work contained in the
Coptic MS. referred to under <i>Gospel of Mary</i> gives cosmological
disclosures and is presumably of Valentinian origin.</p>

<p><i>Apocryph of John.</i>&mdash;This book, which is found in the Coptic
MS. referred to under <i>Gospel of Mary</i> and contains cosmological
disclosures of Christ, is said to have formed the source of Irenaeus&rsquo;
account of the Gnostics of Barbelus (i. 29-31). Thus this work
would have been written before 170.</p>

<p><i>Gospel of Judas Iscariot.</i>&mdash;References to this gospel as in use
among the Cainites are made by Irenaeus (i. 31. 1); Epiphanius
(xxxviii. 1. 3).</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>181</span></p>

<p><i>Gospel, The Living</i> (<i>Evangelium Vivum</i>).&mdash;This was a gospel
of the Manichaeans. See Epiphanius, <i>Haer</i>. lxvi. 2; Photius,
<i>Contra Manich</i>. i.</p>

<p><i>Gospel of Marcion.</i>&mdash;On this important gospel see Zahn, <i>Gesch.
Kanons</i>, i. 585-718.</p>

<p><i>Descent of Mary</i> (<span class="grk" title="Tenna Marias">&#915;&#941;&#957;&#957;&#945; &#924;&#945;&#961;&#943;&#945;&#962;</span>).&mdash;This book was an anti-Jewish
legend representing Zacharias as having been put to
death by the Jews because he had seen the God of the Jews in
the form of an ass in the temple (Epiphanius, <i>Haer</i>. xxvi. 12).</p>

<p><i>Questions of Mary</i> (<i>Great and Little</i>).&mdash;Epiphanius (<i>Haer</i>.
xxvi. 8) gives some excerpts from this revolting work.</p>

<p><i>Gospel of Mary.</i>&mdash;This gospel is found in a Coptic MS. of the
5th century. According to Schmidt&rsquo;s short account, <i>Sitzungsberichte
d. preuss. Akad. d. Wiss. zu. Berlin</i> (1896), pp. 839 sqq.,
this gospel gives disclosures on the nature of matter (<span class="grk" title="ulae">&#8021;&#955;&#951;</span>) and
the progress of the Gnostic soul through the seven planets.</p>

<p><i>Gospel of Matthias.</i>&mdash;Though this gospel is attested by Origen
(<i>Horm. in Luc.</i> i.), Eusebius, <i>H.E.</i> iii. 25. 6, and the List of
Sixty Books, not a shred of it has been preserved, unless with
Zahn ii. 751 sqq. we are to identify it with the <i>Traditions of
Matthias</i>, from which Clement has drawn some quotations.</p>

<p><i>Gospel of Perfection</i> (<i>Evangelium perfectionis</i>).&mdash;Used by the
followers of Basilides and other Gnostics. See Epiphanius, <i>Haer.</i>
xxvi. 2.</p>

<p><i>Gospel of Philip.</i>&mdash;This gospel described the progress of a
soul through the next world. It is of a strongly Encratite
character and dates from the 2nd century. A fragment is preserved
in Epiphanius, <i>Haer</i>. xxvi. 13. In Preuschen, <i>Reste</i>, p. 13,
the quotation breaks off too soon. See Zahn ii. 761-768.</p>

<p><i>Gospel of Thaddaeus.</i>&mdash;Condemned by the Gelasian Decree.</p>

<p><i>Gospel of Thomas.</i>&mdash;Of this gospel only one fragment has been
preserved in Hippolytus, <i>Philos</i>. v. 7, pp. 140 seq. See Zahn,
<i>op. cit.</i> i. 746 seq.; ii. 768-773; Harnack ii. 593-595.</p>

<p><i>Gospel of Truth.</i>&mdash;This gospel is mentioned by Irenaeus i. 11. 9,
and was used by the Valentinians. See Zahn i. 748 sqq.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) <span class="sc">Acts and Teachings of the Apostles</span>.&mdash;<i>Acts of Andrew</i>.&mdash;These
Acts, which are of a strongly Encratite character, have
come down to us in a fragmentary condition. They belong to
the earliest ages, for they are mentioned by Eusebius, <i>H.E.</i> iii.
25; Epiphanius, <i>Haer.</i> xlvii. 1; lxi. 1; lxiii. 2; Philaster,
<i>Haer.</i> lxviii., as current among the Manichaeans and heretics.
They are attributed to Leucius, a Docetic writer, by Augustine
(<i>c. Felic. Manich.</i> ii. 6) and Euodius (<i>De Fide c. Manich.</i> 38).
Euodius in the passage just referred to preserves two small
fragments of the original Acts. On internal grounds the section
recounting Andrew&rsquo;s imprisonment (Bonnet, <i>Acta Apostolorum
Apocrypha</i>, ii. 38-45) is also probably a constituent of the
original work. As regards the martyrdom, owing to the confusion
introduced by the multitudinous Catholic revisions of this
section of the Acts, it is practically impossible to restore its
original form. For a complete discussion of the various documents
see Lipsius, <i>Apokryphen Apostelgeschichte</i>, i. 543-622;
also James in Hastings&rsquo; <i>Bible Dict.</i> i. 92-93; Hennecke, <i>NT.
Apokryphen</i>, <i>in loc.</i> The best texts are given in Bonnet&rsquo;s <i>Acta
Apostolorum Apocrypha</i>, 1898, II. i. 1-127. These contain also
the <i>Acts of Andrew and Matthew</i> (or Matthias) in which Matthew
(or Matthias) is represented as a captive in the country of the
anthropophagi. Christ takes Andrew and his disciples with
Him, and effects the rescue of Matthew. The legend is found also
in Ethiopic, Syriac and Anglo-Saxon. Also the <i>Acts of Peter and
Andrew</i>, which among other incidents recount the miracle of a
camel passing through the eye of a needle. This work is preserved
partly in Greek, but in its entirety in Slavonic.</p>

<p><i>Acts of John.</i>&mdash;Clement of Alexandria in his <i>Hypotyposes</i> on
1 John i. 1 seems to refer to chapters xciii. (or lxxxix.) of these
Acts. Eusebius (<i>H.E.</i> iii. 25. 6), Epiphanius (<i>Haer.</i> xlvii. 1)
and other ancient writers assign them to the authorship of
Leucius Charinus. It is generally admitted that they were
written in the 2nd century. The text has been edited most
completely by Bonnet, <i>Acta Apostol. Apocr.</i>, 1898, 151-216.
The contents might be summarized with Hennecke as follows:&mdash;Arrival
and first sojourn of the apostle in Ephesus (xviii.-lv.);
return to Ephesus and second sojourn (history of Drusiana,
lviii.-lxxxvi.); account of the crucifixion of Jesus and His
apparent death (lxxxvii.-cv.); the death of John (cvi.-cxv.).
There are manifest gaps in the narrative, a fact which we would
infer from the extent assigned to it (<i>i.e.</i> 2500 stichoi) by Nicephorus.
According to this authority one-third of the text is now
lost. Many chapters are lost at the beginning; there is a gap in
chapter xxxvii., also before lviii., not to mention others. The
encratite tendency in these Acts is not so strongly developed
as in those of Andrew and Thomas. James (<i>Anecdota</i>, ii. 1-25)
has given strong grounds for regarding the Acts of John and
Peter as derived from one and the same author, but there are
like affinities existing between the Acts of Peter and those of
Paul. For a discussion of this work see Zahn, <i>Gesch. Kanons</i>,
ii. 856-865; Lipsius, <i>Apok. Apostelgesch.</i> i. 348-542; Hennecke,
<i>NT. Apokryphen</i>, 423-432. For bibliography, Hennecke, <i>NT.
Apok. Handbuch</i>, 492 sq.</p>

<p><i>Acts of Paul.</i>&mdash;The discovery of the Coptic translation of
these Acts in 1897, and its publication by C. Schmidt (<i>Acta
Pauli aus der Heidelberger koptischen Papyrushandschrift
herausgegeben</i>, Leipzig, 1894), have confirmed what had been
previously only a hypothesis that the Acts of Thecla had formed
a part of the larger Acts of Paul. The Acts therefore embrace
now the following elements:&mdash;(<i>a</i>) Two quotations given by
Origen in his <i>Princip.</i> i. 2. 3 and his comment on John xx. 12.
From the latter it follows that in the Acts of Paul the death of
Peter was recounted, (<i>b</i>) <i>Apocryphal 3rd Epistle of Paul to the
Corinthians</i> and <i>Epistle from the Corinthians to Paul</i>. These two
letters are connected by a short account which is intended to give
the historical situation. Paul is in prison on account of Stratonice,
the wife of Apollophanes. The Greek and Latin versions of
these letters have for the most part disappeared, but they have
been preserved in Syriac, and through Syriac they obtained for
the time being a place in the Armenian Bible immediately after
2 Corinthians. Aphraates cites two passages from 3 Corinthians
as words of the apostle, and Ephraem expounded them in his
commentary on the Pauline Epistles. They must therefore have
been regarded as canonical in the first half of the 4th century.
From the Syriac Bible they made their way into the Armenian
and maintained their place without opposition to the 7th century.
On the Latin text see Carrière and Berger, <i>Correspondance
apocr. de S.P. et des Corinthiens</i>, 1891. For a translation of
Ephraem&rsquo;s commentary see Zahn ii. 592-611 and Vetter, <i>Der
Apocr. 3. Korinthien</i>, 70 sqq., 1894. The Coptic version (C.
Schmidt, <i>Acta Pauli</i>, pp. 74-82), which is here imperfect, is
clearly from a Greek original, while the Latin and Armenian are
from the Syriac. (<i>c</i>) <i>The Acts of Paul and Thecla</i>. These were
written, according to Tertullian (<i>De Baptismo</i>, 17) by a presbyter
of Asia, who was deposed from his office on account of his forgery.
This, the earliest of Christian romances (probably before <span class="scs">A.D.</span>
150), recounts the adventures and sufferings of a virgin, Thecla
of Iconium. Lipsius discovers Gnostic traits in the story, but
these are denied by Zahn (<i>Gesch. Kanons</i>, ii. 902). See Lipsius,
<i>op. cit.</i> ii. 424-467; Zahn (<i>op. cit.</i> ii. 892-910). The best text
is that of Lipsius, <i>Acta Apostol. Apocr.</i>, 1891, i. 235-272.
There are Syriac, Arabic, Ethiopic and Slavonic versions.
As we have seen above, these Acts are now recognized as
belonging originally to the Acts of Paul. They were, however,
published separately long before the Gelasian Decree (496).
Jerome also was acquainted with them as an independent work.
Thecla was most probably a real personage, around whom a
legend had already gathered in the 2nd century. Of this legend
the author of the Acts of Paul made use, and introduced into it
certain historical and geographical facts, (<i>d</i>) The healing of
Hermocrates of dropsy in Myra. Through a comparison of the
Coptic version with the Pseudo-Cyprian writing &ldquo;Caena,&rdquo;
Rolffs (Hennecke, <i>NT. Apok.</i> 361) concludes that this incident
formed originally a constituent of our book, (<i>e</i>) The strife with
beasts at Ephesus. This event is mentioned by Nicephorus
Callistus (<i>H.E.</i> ii. 25) as recounted in the <span class="grk" title="perlodoi">&#960;&#949;&#961;&#943;&#959;&#948;&#959;&#953;</span> of Paul.
The identity of this work with the Acts of Paul is confirmed by
a remark of Hippolytus in his commentary on Daniel iii. 29. 4,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>182</span>
ed. Bonwetsch 176 (so Rolffs). (<i>f</i>) Martyrdom of Paul. The
death of Paul by the sentence of Nero at Rome forms the close
of the Acts of Paul. The text is in the utmost confusion. It
is best given by Lipsius, <i>Acta Apostol. Apocr.</i> i. 104-117.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all the care that has been taken in collecting
the fragments of these Acts, only about 900 stichoi out of the
3600 assigned to them in the Stichometry of Nicephorus have as
yet been recovered.</p>

<p>The author was, according to Tertullian (<i>De Baptism.</i> 17), a
presbyter in Asia, who out of honour to Paul wrote the Acts,
forging at the same time 3 Corinthians. Thus the work was
composed before 190, and, since it most probably uses the martyrdom
of Polycarp, after 155. The object of the writer is to
embody in St Paul the model ideal of the popular Christianity
of the 2nd century. His main emphasis is laid on chastity and
the resurrection of the flesh. The tone of the work is Catholic
and anti-Gnostic. For the bibliography of the subject see
Hennecke, <i>NT. Apok.</i> 358-360.</p>

<p><i>Acts of Peter.</i>&mdash;These acts are first mentioned by Eusebius
(<i>H.E.</i> iii. 3) by name, and first referred to by the African poet
Commodian about <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 250. Harnack, who was the first to
show that these Acts were Catholic in character and not Gnostic
as had previously been alleged, assigns their composition to this
period mainly on the ground that Hippolytus was not acquainted
with them; but even were this assumption true, it would not
prove the non-existence of the Acts in question. According to
Photius, moreover, the Acts of Peter also were composed by
this same Leucius Charinus, who, according to Zahn (<i>Gesch.
Kanons</i>, ii. 864), wrote about 160 (<i>op. cit.</i> p. 848). Schmidt and
Ficker, however, maintain that the Acts were written about 200
and in Asia Minor. These Acts, which Ficker holds were written
as a continuation and completion of the canonical Acts of the
Apostles, deal with Peter&rsquo;s victorious conflict with Simon Magus,
and his subsequent martyrdom at Rome under Nero. It is
difficult to determine the relation of the so-called Latin <i>Actus
Vercellenses</i> (which there are good grounds for assuming were
originally called the <span class="grk" title="Praxeis Petrou">&#928;&#961;&#940;&#958;&#949;&#953;&#962; &#928;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#965;</span>) with the Acts of John
and Paul. Schmidt thinks that the author of the former made
use of the latter, James that the Acts of Peter and of John were
by one and the same author, but Ficker is of opinion that their
affinities can be explained by their derivation from the same
ecclesiastical atmosphere and school of theological thought.
No less close affinities exist between our Acts and the Acts of
Thomas, Andrew and Philip. In the case of the Acts of Thomas
the problem is complicated, sometimes the Acts of Peter seem
dependent on the Acts of Thomas, and sometimes the converse.</p>

<p><i>Preaching of Peter.</i>&mdash;This book (<span class="grk" title="Petrou Kêrygma">&#928;&#941;&#964;&#961;&#959;&#965; &#954;&#942;&#961;&#965;&#947;&#956;&#945;</span>) gave the
substance of a series of discourses spoken by one person in the
name of the apostles. Clement of Alexandria quotes it several
times as a genuine record of Peter&rsquo;s teaching. Heracleon had
previously used it (see Origen, <i>In Evang. Johann.</i> t. xiii. 17).
It is spoken unfavourably of by Origen (<i>De Prin.</i> Praef. 8). It
was probably in the hands of Justin and Aristides. Hence
Zahn gives its date as 90-100 at latest; Dobschütz, as 100-110;
and Harnack, as 110-130. The extant fragments contain
sayings of Jesus, and warnings against Judaism and Polytheism.</p>

1893. Salmon (<i>Dict. Christ. Biog.</i> iv. 329-330) thinks that this
work is part of a larger work, <i>A Preaching of Peter and a Preaching
of Paul</i>, implied in a statement of Lactantius (<i>Inst. Div.</i> iv.
21); but this view is contested by Zahn, see <i>Gesch. Kanons</i>, ii.
820-834, particularly pp. 827-828; Chase, in Hastings&rsquo; <i>Bible
Dict.</i> iv. 776.</p>

<p><i>Acts of Thomas.</i>&mdash;This is one of the earliest and most famous
of the Gnostic Acts. It has been but slightly tampered with by
orthodox hands. These Acts were used by the Encratites
(Epiphanius, <i>Haer.</i> xlvii. 1), the Manichaeans (Augustine,
<i>Contra Faust</i>. xxii. 79), the Apostolici (Epiphanius lxi. 1) and
Priscillianists. The work is divided into thirteen Acts, to which
the Martyrdom of Thomas attaches as the fourteenth. It was
originally written in Syriac, as Burkitt (<i>Journ. of Theol. Studies</i>,
i. 278 sqq.) has finally proved, though Macke and Nöldeke had
previously advanced grounds for this view. The Greek and
Latin texts were edited by Bonnet in 1883 and again in 1903,
ii. 2; the Greek also by James, <i>Apoc. Anec.</i> ii. 28-45, and
the Syriac by Wright (<i>Apocr. Acts of the Gospels</i>, 1871, i. 172-333).
Photius ascribes their composition to Leucius Charinus&mdash;therefore
to the 2nd century, but Lipsius assigns it to the
early decades of the 3rd. (See Lipsius, <i>Apokryphen Apostelgeschichten</i>,
i. 225-347; Hennecke, <i>N.T. Apokryphen</i>, 473-480.)</p>

<p><i>Teaching of the Twelve Apostles</i> (Didach&#275;).&mdash;This important
work was discovered by Philotheos Bryennios in Constantinople
and published in 1883. Since that date it has been frequently
edited. The bibliography can be found in Schaff&rsquo;s and in
Harnack&rsquo;s editions. The book divides itself into three parts.
The first (i.-vi.) contains a body of ethical instruction which is
founded on a Jewish and probably pre-Christian document,
which forms the basis also of the <i>Epistle of Barnabas</i>. The
second part consists of vii.-xv., and treats of church ritual and
discipline; and the third part is eschatological and deals with
the second Advent. The book is variously dated by different
scholars: Zahn assigns it to the years <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 80-120; Harnack
to 120-165; Lightfoot and Funk to 80-100; Salmon to 120.
(See Salmon in <i>Dict. of Christ. Biog.</i> iv. 806-815, also article
<span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Didach&#275;</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Apostolical Constitutions.</i>&mdash;For the various collections of
these ecclesiastical regulations&mdash;the Syriac <i>Didascalia, Ecclesiastical
Canons of the Holy Apostles</i>, &amp;c.&mdash;see separate article.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) <span class="sc">Epistles</span>.&mdash;<i>The Abgar Epistles.</i>&mdash;These epistles are found in
Eusebius (<i>H.E.</i> i. 3), who translated them from the Syriac.
They are two in number, and purport to be a petition of Abgar
Uchomo, king of Edessa, to Christ to visit Edessa, and Christ&rsquo;s
answer, promising after his ascension to send one of his disciples,
who should &ldquo;cure thee of thy disease, and give eternal life and
peace to thee and all thy people.&rdquo; Lipsius thinks that these
letters were manufactured about the year 200. (See <i>Dict.
Christ. Biog.</i> iv. 878-881, with the literature there mentioned.)
The above correspondence, which appears also in Syriac, is
inwoven with the legend of Addai or Thaddaeus. The best
critical edition of the Greek text will be found in Lipsius, <i>Acta
Apostolorum Apocrypha</i>, 1891, pp. 279-283. (See also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Abgar</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Epistle of Barnabas.</i>&mdash;The special object of this epistle was to
guard its readers against the danger of relapsing into Judaism.
The date is placed by some scholars as early as 70-79, by others
as late as the early years of the emperor Hadrian, 117. The
text has been edited by Hilgenfeld in 1877, Gebhardt and
Harnack in 1878, and Funk in 1887 and 1901. In these works
will be found full bibliographies. (See further <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Barnabas</a></span>.)</p>

<p><i>Epistle of Clement.</i>&mdash;The object of this epistle is the restoration
of harmony to the church of Corinth, which had been vexed by
internal discussions. The epistle may be safely ascribed to the
years 95-96. The writer was in all probability the bishop of
Rome of that name. He is named an apostle and his work was
reckoned as canonical by Clement of Alexandria (<i>Strom.</i> iv. 17.
105), and as late as the time of Eusebius (<i>H.E.</i> iii. 16) it was still
read in some of the churches. Critical editions have been
published by Gebhardt and Harnack, <i>Patr. Apost. Op.</i>, 1876,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page183" id="page183"></a>183</span>
and in the smaller form in 1900, Lightfoot<span class="sp">2</span>, 1890, Funk<span class="sp">2</span>, 1901.
The Syriac version has been edited by Kennet, <i>Epp. of St
Clement to the Corinthians in Syriac</i>, 1899, and the Old Latin
version by Morin, <i>S. Clementis Romani ad Corinthios epistulae
versio Latina antiquissima</i>, 1894.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<i>Clement&rsquo;s</i>&rdquo; <i>2nd Ep. to the Corinthians.</i>&mdash;This so-called
letter of Clement is not mentioned by any writer before Eusebius
(<i>H. E</i>. iii. 38. 4). It is not a letter but really a homily written in
Rome about the middle of the 2nd century. The writer is a
Gentile. Some of his citations are derived from the Gospel to
the Egyptians.</p>

<p><i>Clement&rsquo;s Epistles on Virginity.</i>&mdash;These two letters are preserved
only in Syriac which is a translation from the Greek.
They are first referred to by Epiphanius and next by Jerome.
Critics have assigned them to the middle of the 2nd century.
They have been edited by Beelen, Louvain, 1856.</p>

<p><i>Clement&rsquo;s Epistles to James.</i>&mdash;On these two letters which are
found in the Clementine Homilies, see Smith&rsquo;s <i>Dict. of Christian
Biography</i>, i. 559, 570, and Lehmann&rsquo;s monograph, <i>Die Clementischen
Schriften</i>, Gotha, 1867, in which references will be found to
other sources of information.</p>

<p><i>Epistles of Ignatius.</i>&mdash;There are two collections of letters
bearing the name of Ignatius, who was martyred between 105
and 117. The first consists of seven letters addressed by Ignatius
to the Ephesians, Magnesians, Trallians, Romans, Philadelphians,
Smyrnaeans and to Polycarp. The second collection consists of
the preceding extensively interpolated, and six others of Mary
to Ignatius, of Ignatius to Mary, to the Tarsians, Antiochians,
Philippians and Hero, a deacon of Antioch. The latter collection
is a pseudepigraph written in the 4th century or the beginning
of the 5th. The authenticity of the first collection also has been
denied, but the evidence appears to be against this contention.
The literature is overwhelming in its extent. See Zahn, <i>Patr.
Apost. Op</i>., 1876; Funk<span class="sp">2</span>, <i>Die apostol. Väter</i>, 1901; Lightfoot<span class="sp">2</span>,
<i>Apostolic Fathers</i>, 1889.</p>

<p><i>Epistle of Polycarp.</i>&mdash;The genuineness of this epistle stands
or falls with that of the Ignatian epistles. See article in Smith&rsquo;s
<i>Dictionary of Christian Biography</i>, iv. 423-431; Lightfoot,
<i>Apostolic Fathers</i>, i. 629-702; also <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Polycarp</a></span>.</p>

<p><i>Pauline Epistles to the Laodiceans and the Alexandrians</i>.&mdash;
The first of these is found only in Latin. This, according to
Lightfoot (see <i>Colossians</i><span class="sp">3</span>, 272-298) and Zahn, is a translation
from the Greek. Such an epistle is mentioned in the Muratorian
canon. See Zahn, <i>op. cit</i>. ii. 566-585. The Epistle to the
Alexandrians is mentioned only in the Muratorian canon (see
Zahn ii. 586-592).</p>

Thus though it insisted on the exclusive canonicity of the 24 books,
it claimed the possession of an oral law handed down from Moses,
and just as the apocryphal books overshadowed in certain instances
the canonical scriptures, so often the oral law displaced the written
in the regard of Judaism.</p>

<p><span class="bold">APOLLINARIS,<a name="ar230" id="ar230"></a></span> &ldquo;the Younger&rdquo; (d. <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 390), bishop of Laodicea
in Syria. He collaborated with his father Apollinaris the Elder
in reproducing the Old Testament in the form of Homeric and
Pindaric poetry, and the New after the fashion of Platonic
dialogues, when the emperor Julian had forbidden Christians to
teach the classics. He is best known, however, as a warm
opponent of Arianism, whose eagerness to emphasize the deity
of Christ and the unity of His person led him so far as a denial
of the existence of a rational human soul (<span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>) in Christ&rsquo;s
human nature, this being replaced in Him by a prevailing
principle of holiness, to wit the Logos, so that His body was a
glorified and spiritualized form of humanity. Over against this
the orthodox or Catholic position maintained that Christ assumed
human nature in its entirety including the <span class="grk" title="nous">&#957;&#959;&#8166;&#962;</span>, for only so
could He be example and redeemer. It was held that the system
of Apollinaris was really Docetism (see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Docetae</a></span>), that if the
Godhood without constraint swayed the manhood there was no
possibility of real human probation or of real advance in Christ&rsquo;s
manhood. The position was accordingly condemned by several
synods and in particular by that of Constantinople (<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 381).
This did not prevent its having a considerable following, which
after Apollinaris&rsquo;s death divided into two sects, the more
conservative taking its name (Vitalians) from Vitalis, bishop of
Antioch, the other (Polemeans) adding the further assertion
that the two natures were so blended that even the body of
Christ was a fit object of adoration. The whole Apollinarian
type of thought persisted in what was later the Monophysite
(<i>q.v.</i>) school.</p>

<div class="condensed">
<p>Although Apollinaris was a prolific writer, scarcely anything has
survived under his own name. But a number of his writings are
concealed under the names of orthodox Fathers, <i>e.g.</i> <span class="grk" title="He kata meros

<span class="scs">A.D.</span> 430. Belonging to a noble family, he was educated under
the best masters, and particularly excelled in poetry and polite
literature. He married (about 452) Papianilla, the daughter of
Avitus, who was consul and afterwards emperor. But Majorianus,
in the year 457, having deprived Avitus of the empire and
taken the city of Lyons, Apollinaris fell into the hands of the
enemy. The reputation of his learning led Majorianus to treat
him with the greatest respect. In return Apollinaris composed
a panegyric in his honour (as he had previously done for Avitus),
which won for him a statue at Rome and the title of count. In
467 the emperor Anthemius rewarded him for the panegyric
which he had written in honour of him by raising him to the
post of prefect of Rome, and afterwards to the dignity of a
patrician and senator. In 472, more for his political than for
his theological abilities, he was chosen to succeed Eparchius in
the bishopric of Arverna (Clermont). On the capture of that city
by the Goths in 474 he was imprisoned, as he had taken an active
part in its defence; but he was afterwards restored by Euric,
king of the Goths, and continued to govern his bishopric as before.
He died in <span class="scs">A.D.</span> 487 or 488. His extant works are his <i>Panegyrics</i>
on different emperors (in which he draws largely upon Statius,
Ausonius and Claudian); and nine books of <i>Letters</i> and <i>Poems</i>,
whose chief value consists in the light they shed on the political
and literary history of the 5th century. The <i>Letters</i>, which are
very stilted, also reveal Apollinaris as a man of genial temper,
fond of good living and of pleasure. The best edition is that in
the <i>Monumenta Germaniae Historica</i> (Berlin, 1887), which gives
a survey of the manuscripts.</p>

of the most important and many-sided of the Olympian divinities.
No satisfactory etymology of the name has been given, the least
improbable perhaps being that which connects it with the Doric
<span class="grk" title="apella">&#7936;&#960;&#941;&#955;&#955;&#945;</span> (&ldquo;assembly&rdquo;)<a name="fa1n" id="fa1n" href="#ft1n"><span class="sp">1</span></a> so that Apollo would be the god of
political life (for other suggested derivations, ancient and
modern, see C. Wernicke in Pauly-Wissowa&rsquo;s <i>Realencyclopädie</i>).
The derivation of all the functions assigned to him from the idea
of a single original light- or sun-god, worked out in his <i>Lexikon der
Mythologie</i> by Roscher, who regards it as &ldquo;one of the most
certain facts in mythology,&rdquo; has not found general acceptance,
although no doubt some features of his character can be readily
explained on this assumption.</p>

<p>In the legend, as set forth in the Homeric hymn to Apollo
and the ode of Callimachus to Delos, Apollo is the son of Zeus
and Leto. The latter, pursued by the jealous Hera, after long
wandering found shelter in Delos (originally Asteria), where she
bore a son, Apollo, under a palm-tree at the foot of Mount
Cynthus. Before this, Delos&mdash;like Rhodes, the centre of the
worship of the sun-god Helios, with whom Apollo was wrongly
identified in later times&mdash;had been a barren, floating rock, but
now became stationary, being fastened down by chains to the
bottom of the sea. Apollo was born on the 7th day (<span class="grk" title="Ebdomagenês">&#7953;&#946;&#948;&#959;&#956;&#945;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#942;&#962;</span>)
of the month Thargelion according to Delian, of the month
Bysios according to Delphian, tradition. The 7th and 20th,
the days of the new and full moon, were ever afterwards held
sacred to him. In Homer Apollo appears only as the god of
prophecy, the sender of plagues, and sometimes as a warrior,
but elsewhere as exercising the most varied functions. He is
the god of agriculture, specially connected with Aristaeus (<i>q.v.</i>),
which, originally a mere epithet, became an independent personality
(see, however, Farnell, <i>Cults of the Greek States</i>, iv. 123).
This side of his character is clearly expressed in the titles <i>Sitalcas</i>
(&ldquo;protector of corn&rdquo;); <i>Erythibius</i> (&ldquo;preventer of blight&rdquo;);
<i>Parnopius</i> (&ldquo;destroyer of locusts&rdquo;); <i>Smintheus</i> (&ldquo;destroyer of
mice&rdquo;), in which, however, some modern inquirers see a totemistic
significance (<i>e.g.</i> A. Lang, &ldquo;Apollo and the Mouse,&rdquo; in
<i>Custom and Myth</i>, p. 101; against this, W.W. Fowler, in
<i>Classical Review</i>, November 1892); <i>Erithius</i> (&ldquo;god of reapers&rdquo;);
and <i>Pasparius</i> (&ldquo;god of meal&rdquo;). He is further the god of
vegetation generally&mdash;<i>Nomios</i>, &ldquo;god of pastures&rdquo; (explained,
however, by Cicero, as &ldquo;god of law&rdquo;), <i>Hersos</i>, &ldquo;sender of the
fertilizing dew.&rdquo; Valleys and groves are under his protection,
unless the epithets <i>Napaeus</i> and <i>Hylates</i> belong to a more primitive
aspect of the god as supporting himself by the chase, and
roaming the glades and forests in pursuit of prey. Certain trees
and plants, especially the laurel, were sacred to him. As the
god of agriculture and vegetation he is naturally connected with
the course of the year and the arrangement of the seasons, so
important in farming operations, and becomes the orderer of
time (<i>Horomedon</i>, &ldquo;ruler of the seasons&rdquo;), and frequently
appears on monuments in company with the Horae.</p>

<p>Apollo is also the protector of cattle and herds, hence <i>Poimnius</i>
(&ldquo;god of flocks&rdquo;), <i>Tragius</i> (&ldquo;of goats&rdquo;), <i>Kereatas</i> (&ldquo;of horned
animals&rdquo;). <i>Carneius</i> (probably &ldquo;horned&rdquo;) is considered by
some to be a pre-Dorian god of cattle, also connected with
harvest operations, whose cult was grafted on to that of Apollo;
by others, to have been originally an epithet of Apollo, afterwards
detached as a separate personality (Farnell, <i>Cults</i>, iv. p. 131).
The epithet <i>Maleatas</i>, which, as the quantity of the first vowel (&#259;)
shows,<a name="fa2n" id="fa2n" href="#ft2n"><span class="sp">2</span></a> cannot mean god of &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; or &ldquo;the apple-tree,&rdquo; is
probably a local adjective derived from Malea (perhaps Cape
Malea), and may refer to an originally distinct personality,
subsequently merged in that of Apollo (see below). Apollo himself
is spoken of as a keeper of flocks, and the legends of his
service as a herdsman with Laomedon and Admetus point in the
same direction. Here probably also is to be referred the epithet
<i>Lyceius</i>, which, formerly connected with <span class="grk" title="luk-">&#955;&#965;&#954;-</span> (&ldquo;shine&rdquo;) and
used to support the conception of Apollo as a light-god, is now
generally referred to <span class="grk" title="Lukos">&#955;&#973;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span> (&ldquo;wolf&rdquo;) and explained as he who
keeps away the wolves from the flock (cf. <span class="grk" title="lukoergos, lukoktonos">&#955;&#965;&#954;&#972;&#949;&#961;&#947;&#959;&#962;, &#955;&#965;&#954;&#959;&#954;&#964;&#972;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>).
In accordance with this, the epithet <span class="grk" title="Lukogenês">&#955;&#965;&#954;&#951;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#942;&#962;</span> will not mean
&ldquo;born of&rdquo; or &ldquo;begetting light,&rdquo; but rather &ldquo;born from the
she-wolf,&rdquo; in which form Leto herself was said to have been
conducted by wolves to Delos. The consecration of the wolf to
Apollo is probably the relic of an ancient totemistic religion
(Farnell, <i>Cults</i>, i. 41; W. Robertson Smith, <i>Religion of the
Semites</i>, new ed., 1894, p. 226).</p>

<p>With the care of the fruits of the earth and the lower animals
is associated that of the highest animal, man, especially the
youth on his passage to manhood. As such Apollo is <span class="grk" title="kourotrophos">&#954;&#959;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#964;&#961;&#972;&#966;&#959;&#962;</span> (&ldquo;rearer of boys&rdquo;) and patron of the palaestra. In many places
gymnastic contests form a feature of his festivals, and he himself
is proficient in athletic exercises (<span class="grk" title="enagonios">&#7952;&#957;&#945;&#947;&#974;&#957;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>). Thus he was
supposed to be the first victor at the Olympic games; he overcomes
Hermes in the foot-race, and Ares in boxing.</p>

<p>The transition is easy to Apollo as a warlike god; in fact, the
earlier legends represent him as engaged in strife with Python,
Tityus, the Cyclopes and the Aloidae. He is <i>Boëdromios</i> (&ldquo;the
helper&rdquo;), <i>Eleleus</i> (&ldquo;god of the war-cry&rdquo;), and the Paean was
said to have been originally a song of triumph composed by him
after his victory over Python. In Homer he frequently appears
on the field, like Ares and Athene, bearing the aegis to frighten
the foe. This aspect is confirmed by the epithets <i>Argyrotoxos</i>
(&ldquo;god of the silver bow&rdquo;), <i>Hecatebolos</i> (&ldquo;the shooter from
afar&rdquo;), <i>Chrysaoros</i> (&ldquo;wearer of the golden sword&rdquo;), and his
statues are often equipped with the accoutrements of war.<a name="fa3n" id="fa3n" href="#ft3n"><span class="sp">3</span></a></p>

<p>The fame of the Pythian oracle at Delphi, connected with the
slaying of Python by the god immediately after his birth, gave
especial prominence to the idea of Apollo as a god of prophecy.
Python, always represented in the form of a snake, sometimes
nameless, is the symbol of the old chthonian divinity whose
home was the place of &ldquo;enquiry&rdquo; (<span class="grk" title="pythesthai">&#960;&#965;&#952;&#941;&#963;&#952;&#945;&#953;</span>). When Apollo
Delphinius with his worshippers from Crete took possession of
the earth-oracle Python, he received in consequence the name
Pythius. That Python was no fearful monster, symbolizing the
darkness of winter which is scattered by the advent of spring,
is shown by the fact that Apollo was considered to have been
guilty of murder in slaying it, and compelled to wander for a
term of years and expiate his crime by servitude and purification.
Possibly at Delphi and other places there was an old serpent-worship
ousted by that of Apollo, which may account for expiation
for the slaying of Python being considered necessary. In
the solar explanation, the serpent is the darkness driven away by
the rays of the sun. (On the Delphian cult of Apollo and its
political significance, see <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Amphictyony</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Delphi</a></span>, <span class="sc"><a href="#artlinks">Oracle</a></span>; and
Farnell, <i>Cults</i>, iv. pp. 179-218.) Oracular responses were also
given at Claros near Colophon in Ionia by means of the water of
a spring which inspired those who drank of it; at Patara in
Lycia; and at Didyma near Miletus through the priestly family
of the Branchidae. Apollo&rsquo;s oracles, which he did not deliver
on his own initiative but as the mouthpiece of Zeus, were infallible,
but the human mind was not always able to grasp their
meaning; hence he is called <i>Loxias</i> (&ldquo;crooked,&rdquo; &ldquo;ambiguous&rdquo;).
To certain favoured mortals he communicated the gift of prophecy
(Cassandra, the Cumaean sibyl, Helenus, Melampus and
Epimenides). Although his favourite method was by word of
mouth, yet signs were sometimes used; thus Calchas interpreted
the flight of birds; burning offerings, sacrificial barley, the arrow
of the god, dreams and the lot, all played their part in communicating
the will of the gods.</p>

<p>Closely connected with the god of oracles was the god of the
healing art, the oracle being frequently consulted in cases of
sickness. These two functions are indicated by the titles
<i>Iatromantis</i> (&ldquo;physician and seer&rdquo;) and <i>Oulios</i>, probably
meaning &ldquo;health-giving&rdquo; (so Suidas) rather than &ldquo;destructive.&rdquo;
This side of Apollo&rsquo;s character does not appear in Homer, where
Paieon is mentioned as the physician of the gods. Here again,
as in the case of Aristaeus and Carneius, the question arises
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page185" id="page185"></a>185</span>
whether Paean (or Paeon) was originally an epithet of Apollo,
subsequently developed into an independent personality, or
an independent deity merged in the later arrival (Farnell, <i>Cults</i>,
iv. p. 234). According to Wilamowitz-Möllendorff in his edition
of Isyllus, the epithet Maleatas alluded to above is also connected
with the functions of the healing god, imported into Athens in
the 4th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> with other well-known health divinities.
In this connexion, it is said to mean the &ldquo;gentle one,&rdquo; who gave
his name to the rock Malion or Maleas (O. Gruppe, <i>Griechische
Mythologie</i>, ii. 1442) on the Gortynian coast. Apollo is further
supposed to be the father of Asclepius (Aesculapius), whose
ritual is closely modelled upon his. The healing god could
also prevent disease and misfortune of all kinds: hence he is
<span class="grk" title="alexikakos">&#7936;&#955;&#949;&#958;&#943;&#954;&#945;&#954;&#959;&#962;</span> (&ldquo;averter of evil&rdquo;) and <span class="grk" title="apotropaios">&#7936;&#960;&#959;&#964;&#961;&#972;&#960;&#945;&#953;&#959;&#962;</span>. Further,
he is able to purify the guilty and to cleanse from sin (here some
refer the epithet <span class="grk" title="iatromantis">&#7984;&#945;&#964;&#961;&#972;&#956;&#945;&#957;&#964;&#953;&#962;</span>, in the sense of &ldquo;physician of the
soul&rdquo;). Such a task can be fitly undertaken by Apollo, since
he himself underwent purification after slaying Python. According
to the Delphic legend, this took place in the laurel grove of
Tempe, and after nine years of penance the god returned, as was
represented in the festival called Stepterion or Septerion (see
A. Mommsen, <i>Delphika</i>, 1878). Thus the old law of blood for
blood, which only perpetuated the crime from generation to
generation, gave way to the milder idea of the expiatory power
of atonement for murder (cf. the court called <span class="grk" title="to epi Delphinio">&#964;&#8056; &#7952;&#960;&#8054; &#916;&#949;&#955;&#966;&#953;&#957;&#943;&#8179;</span> at
Athens, which retained jurisdiction in cases where justifiable
homicide was pleaded).</p>

<p>The same element of enthusiasm that affects the priestess of
the oracle at Delphi produces song and music. The close connexion
between prophecy and song is indicated in Homer
(<i>Odyssey</i>, viii. 488), where Odysseus suggests that the lay of the
fall of Troy by Demodocus was inspired by Apollo or the Muse.
The metrical form of the oracular responses at Delphi, the
important part played by the paean and the Pythian nomos in
his ritual, contributed to make Apollo a god of song and music,
friend and leader of the Muses (<span class="grk" title="mousagetês">&#956;&#959;&#965;&#963;&#945;&#947;&#941;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span>). He plays the
lyre at the banquets of the gods, and causes Marsyas to be flayed
alive because he had boasted of his superior skill in playing the
flute, and the ears of Midas to grow long because he had declared
in favour of Pan, who contended that the flute was a better
instrument than Apollo&rsquo;s favourite, the lyre.</p>

<p>A less important aspect of Apollo is that of a marine deity,
due to the spread of his cult to the Greek colonies and islands.
As such, his commonest name is <i>Delphinius</i>, the &ldquo;dolphin god,&rdquo;
in whose honour the festival Delphinia was celebrated in Attica.
This cult probably originated in Crete, whence the god in the form
of a dolphin led his Cretan worshippers to the Delphian shore,
where he bade them erect an altar in his honour. He is <i>Epibaterius</i>
and <i>Apobaterius</i> (&ldquo;embarker&rdquo; and &ldquo;disembarker&rdquo;), <i>Nasiotas</i>
(&ldquo;the islander&rdquo;), <i>Euryalus</i> (&ldquo;god of the broad sea&rdquo;). Like
Poseidon, he looks forth over his watery kingdom from lofty
cliffs and promontories (<span class="grk" title="aktaios">&#7936;&#954;&#964;&#945;&#8150;&#959;&#962;</span>, and perhaps <span class="grk" title="akritas">&#7936;&#954;&#961;&#943;&#964;&#945;&#962;</span>).</p>

<p>These maritime cults of Apollo are probably due to his importance
as the god of colonization, who accompanied emigrants on
their voyage. As such he is <span class="grk" title="agêtor">&#7936;&#947;&#942;&#964;&#969;&#961;</span> (&ldquo;leader&rdquo;), <span class="grk" title="oikistês">&#959;&#7984;&#954;&#943;&#963;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span>
(&ldquo;founder&rdquo;), <span class="grk" title="domatitês">&#948;&#969;&#956;&#945;&#964;&#943;&#964;&#951;&#962;</span> (&ldquo;god of the home&rdquo;). As <i>Agyieus</i>
(&ldquo;god of streets and ways&rdquo;), in the form of a stone pillar with
painted head, placed before the doors of houses, he let in the good
and kept out the evil (see Farnell, <i>Cults</i>, iv. p. 150, who takes
Agyieus to mean &ldquo;leader&rdquo;); on the epithet <i>Prostaterius</i>, he
who &ldquo;stands before the house,&rdquo; hence &ldquo;protector,&rdquo; see G.M.
Hirst in <i>Journal of Hellenic Studies</i>, xxii. (1902). Lastly, as the
originator and protector of civil order, Apollo was regarded as the
founder of cities and legislation. Thus, at Athens, Apollo <i>Patroös</i>
was known as the protector of the lonians, and the Spartans
referred the institutions of Lycurgus to the Delphic oracle.</p>

<p>It has been mentioned above that W.H. Roscher, in the article
&ldquo;Apollo&rdquo; in his <i>Lexikon der Mythologie</i>, derives all the aspects
and functions of Apollo from the conception of an original light-
and sun-god. The chief objections to this are the following. It
cannot be shown that on <i>Greek</i> soil Apollo originally had the
meaning of a sun-god; in Homer, Aeschylus and Plato, the
sun-god Helios is distinctly separated from Phoebus Apollo;
the constant epithet <span class="grk" title="Phoibos">&#934;&#959;&#8150;&#946;&#959;&#962;</span>, usually explained as the brightness
of the sun, may equally well refer to his physical beauty or
moral purity; <span class="grk" title="lykêgenês">&#955;&#965;&#954;&#951;&#947;&#949;&#957;&#942;&#962;</span> has already been noticed. It is not
until the beginning of the 5th century <span class="scs">B.C.</span> that the identification
makes its appearance. The first literary evidence is a fragment
of Euripides (<i>Phaëthon</i>), in which it is especially characterized
as an innovation. The idea was taken up by the Stoics, and in
the Roman period generally accepted. But the fact of the
gradual development of Apollo as a god of light and heaven, and
his identification with foreign sun-gods, is no proof of an original
Greek solar conception of him. Apollo-Helios must be regarded
as &ldquo;a late by-product of Greek religion&rdquo; (Farnell, <i>Cults</i>, iv.
p. 136; Wernicke in Pauly-Wissowa&rsquo;s <i>Realencydopädie</i>). For
the manner in which the solar theory is developed, reference
must be made to Roscher&rsquo;s article, but one legend may here be
mentioned, since it helps to trace the spread of the cult of the
god. It was said that Apollo soon after his birth spent a year
amongst the Hyperboreans, who dwelt in a land of perpetual
sunshine, before his return to Delphi. This return is explained
as the second birth of the god and his victory over the powers
of winter; the name Hyperboreans is explained as the &ldquo;dwellers
beyond the north wind.&rdquo; This interpretation is now, however,
generally rejected in favour of that of H.L. Ahrens,&mdash;that
Hyperborei is identical with the Perphereës (&ldquo;the carriers&rdquo;),
who are described as the servants of Apollo, carriers of cereal
offerings from one community to another (Herodotus iv. 33).
This would point to the fact that certain settlements of Apolline
worship along the northernmost border of Greece (Illyria, Thrace,
Macedonia) were in the habit of sending offerings to the god to
a centre of his worship farther south (probably Delphi), advancing
by the route from Tempe through Thessaly, Pherae and Doris
to Delphi; while others adopted the route through Illyria,
Epirus, Dodona, the Malian gulf, Carystus in Euboea, and Tenos
to Delos (Farnell, <i>Cults</i>, iv. p. 100).</p>

<p>The most usual attributes of Apollo were the lyre and the
bow; the tripod especially was dedicated to him as the god of
prophecy. Among plants, the bay, used in expiatory sacrifices
and also for making the crown of victory at the Pythian games,
and the palm-tree, under which he was born in Delos, were sacred
to him; among animals and birds, the wolf, the roe, the swan,
the hawk, the raven, the crow, the snake, the mouse, the grasshopper
and the griffin, a mixture of the eagle and the lion
evidently of Eastern origin. The swan and grasshopper symbolize
music and song; the hawk, raven, crow and snake have reference
to his functions as the god of prophecy.</p>

<p>The chief festivals held in honour of Apollo were the Carneia,
Daphnephoria, Delia, Hyacinthia, Pyanepsia, Pythia and
Thargelia (see separate articles).</p>

<p>Among the Romans the worship of Apollo was adopted from
the Greeks. There is a tradition that the Delphian oracle was
consulted as early as the period of the kings during the reign of
Tarquinius Superbus, and in 430 a temple was dedicated to
Apollo on the occasion of a pestilence, and during the Second
Punic War (in 212) the <i>Ludi Apollinares</i> were instituted in his
honour. But it was in the time of Augustus, who considered
himself under the special protection of Apollo and was even said
to be his son, that his worship developed and he became one of
the chief gods of Rome. After the battle of Actium, Augustus
enlarged his old temple, dedicated a portion of the spoil to him,
and instituted quinquennial games in his honour. He also
erected a new temple on the Palatine hill and transferred the
secular games, for which Horace composed his <i>Carmen Saeculare</i>,
to Apollo and Diana.</p>

<p>Apollo was represented more frequently than any other deity
in ancient art. As Apollo Agyieus he was shown by a simple
conic pillar; the Apollo of Amyclae was a pillar of bronze surmounted
by a helmeted head, with extended arms carrying lance
and bow. There were also rude idols of him in wood (<i>xoana</i>), in
which the human form was scarcely recognizable. In the 6th
century, his statues of stone were naked, stiff and rigid in
attitude, shoulders square, limbs strong and broad, hair falling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="page186" id="page186"></a>186</span>
down the back. In the riper period of art the type is softer, and
Apollo appears in a form which seeks to combine manhood and
eternal youth. His long hair is usually tied in a large knot above
his forehead. The most famous statue of him is the Apollo
Belvidere in the Vatican (found at Frascati, 1455), an imitation
belonging to the early imperial period of a bronze statue representing
him, with aegis in his left hand, driving back the Gauls
from his temple at Delphi (279 <span class="scs">B.C.</span>), or, according to another
view, fighting with the Pythian dragon. In the Apollo Citharoedus
or Musagetes in the Vatican, he is crowned with laurel
and wears the long, flowing robe of the Ionic bard, and his form
is almost feminine in its fulness; in a statue at Rome of the
older and more vigorous type he is naked and holds a lyre in his
left hand; his right arm rests upon his head, and a griffin is
seated at his side. The Apollo Sauroctonus (after Praxiteles),
copied in bronze at the Villa Albani in Rome and in marble at
Paris, is a naked, youthful, almost boyish figure, leaning against
a tree, waiting to strike a lizard climbing up the trunk. The
gigantic statue of Helios (the sun-god), &ldquo;the colossus of Rhodes,&rdquo;
by Chares of Lindus, celebrated as one of the seven wonders of
the world, is unknown to us. Bas-reliefs and painted vases
reproduce the contests of Apollo with Tityus, Marsyas, and
Heracles, the slaughter of the daughters of Niobe, and other
incidents in his life.</p>
